            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:57308:4"/>
(whoſe works and enterpriſes were moſt wonderful) had ordained it to be ſo, and thereupon he comforted himſelf, going down into the body of the ſhip (where the day before that great aſſembly had béen) but he found no man; and ſéeking further, he went into the chappel, where he eſpied <hi>Sergil</hi> his ſquire faſt ſléeping, and hard by him two old men with rolls on their heads, apparelled like Turks: with that he went to <hi>Sergil,</hi> and with his foot gave him ſuch a thruſt, that on a ſudden he ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up, and ſpeaking to his maſter (as though he had never ſeen him before) asked him what he meant, whereat <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> began to laugh, and ſaid unto him: Good God, <hi>Sergil,</hi> haſt thou béen in my company all thy life time, and knoweſt me no better? and taking him by the hand, he drew him in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to him that therewith he awaked, much aſhamed to have committed ſuch a fault: whereof ſéeking to excuſe himſelf, he ſaid unto his maſter, By my faith ſir, I was ſo faſt aſléep when you called me, that I neither remembered you nor my ſelf, and I am now more a baſhed then I was before to think how I fell into ſo ſound a ſléep: That cannot I tell (anſwered <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) although as much hath happened unto me. Then he told him that he had ſlept, and when he awaked he found himſelf alone betwéen the wings of the Serpent, without any of the company that were with him when he received the order of Knighthood, and now (ſaid he) we are arrived at the foot of the higheſt rock that ever I ſaw, and withal it is ſo hard and difficult to climb up, that I can finde neither path nor way how to do it, yet have I beheld it long, but (as I perce give) it is environed with the Sea in ſuch manner, that conſider in the ſcituation of the place, I certainly believe it is the Rock of the Enchauntreſs, whereof in times paſt thou haſt heard by <hi>Amadis</hi> my father. And as they were in this manner ſpeaking, <hi>Sergil</hi> heard the two old men ſnort (that as yet they had not once perceived) and demanded of <hi>Eſplandian</hi> if he knew them not: As God help me no (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi> for as far as I remember I never ſaw them before, but I judge that <hi>Urganda</hi> hath left them here to help us if we need. I pray you ſaid <hi>Sergil</hi> let us awake them: then he called them ſo loud that they roſe up, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> asking them who brought them thither,
<pb facs="tcp:57308:4"/>
but they made ſigns that they could not ſpeak. It was then about twelve of the clock, and <hi>Eſplandian</hi> would willingly have eaten if he had found meat, and ſaid unto <hi>Sergil,</hi> Friend, never in all my life had I ſo good an appetite to eat as I have now, but I doubt we ſhall find no victuals in the ſhip, I pray the <hi>Sergil</hi> let us go ſée, for as I perceive, if we truſt unto theſe dumb men, we are like to fare but hardly: but the dumb men perceived well what he meant: wherefore going out of the chappel they entred into a chamber that joined to the hall, from whence they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returned, bringing with them ſuch quantity of meat that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplandian</hi> and <hi>Sergil</hi> were never better ſatisfied in all their lives: having dyned and the tables uncovered, they went into the place where <hi>Eſplandian</hi> had ſlept, from whence he ſhewed <hi>Sergil</hi> the rock whereof he had told him before, ſaying: Aſſure thy ſelf <hi>Sergil,</hi> ſéeing the ſerpent ſtirreth not from hence, it is a ſign that I muſt go upon this high rock to ſée if there be any adventures, and if I can bring them to an end. I know not (anſwered <hi>Sergil</hi>) what you will do, but if you truſt to the counſel of our dumb men we ſhall ſtay long enough here before we have any words of them. Let us land (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) and with that he made ſigns to the old men, that they ſhould hoiſe out the boat, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they willingly obeyed: which done, the firſt that entred was <hi>Sergil,</hi> then <hi>Eſplandian</hi> (armed in the ſame armour he ware when the great <hi>Balan</hi> dubbed him knight) and rowing with their oares they made towards the rock, at the foot whereof they deſcended out of the boat, leaving the two dumb men alone in the ſerpent, and as they were looking for a way to get up, they found the ſame path that <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Granſador</hi> had taken when they went up to ſee the ſtrange adventures that the Enchauntereſs had left there, and they had not travelled long, but that <hi>Sergil</hi> perceived his maſter to want a ſword, (for of all other armour he was wel furniſhed when he received the order of Knighthood onely of a ſword) wherefore he ſaid unto him: Sir, I know not whither you mean to go, but if we paſs forward, and that upon the top of this rock, if you find any dangerous adventure, you have nothing to defend your ſelf withal, but if you will believe me, you ſhall rather take an oar out of our boat, for oftentimes the ſtouteſt

man is overcome, not for want of courage or ſtomack to reſiſt, but for want of weapons to defend himſelf, and with that he went back unto the boat, and bringing one of the oares with him, gave it to his maſter, in which manner they began to mount upon the Rock not without great pain, the way being ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they ceaſed not to travail day and night, till they arrived at the Hermitage, where the image of braſs ſtood with a ſerole of writing at his féet (as you have read in the fourth book) which as then they could not diſcern by reaſon it was dark, wherefore they determined to paſs the night under the gate, not entering any further, for it was extream hot. Then <hi>Eſplandian</hi> put off his Helmet, and laying down his Shield, eat ſuch meat as his Squire had brought with him: which done, lying down upon the graſs he ſtept till the morning that he and <hi>Sergil</hi> entered into the chappel, where they beheld the image and the writing, but neither of them could read it becauſe the letters were in Gréek, which they underſtood not. Then <hi>Eſplandian</hi> determining to go further, ſaid to <hi>Sergil,</hi> Friend, it is beſt for you to ſtay here till I come again, for if this be the rock where my father and <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador</hi> (whether it were by fortune or willingly) did once arrive, I remember I have heard them tell, that in Summer the air is ſo hot therein that it bréedeth many venomous beaſts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou mighteſt receive ſome harm, being no better armed then th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What, ſaid <hi>Sergil,</hi> Do you think that although I ſhould die a thouſand deaths I would refuſe to go with you? No by my faith, for I know that without your company life wil be irkſomer to me then a thouſand deaths if a man could endure ſo many. Friend, anſwered <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> I believe it well, nevertheleſs if any inconvenience ſhould happen unto thée, beſides the blame I might receive thereby, thy déed would be more eſtéemed folly, then done of any courage: but not

to me that have both armour and ſhield to fight againſt the ſtrongeſt enemy that may be found, wherefore I pray thée once again do as I would have thée. Wherewith <hi>Sergil</hi> perceiving no remedy, turned his head aſide and began to wéep. In the mean time <hi>Eſplandian</hi> laced on his Helmet, and hanging his Shield about his neck with the oar on his ſhoulder, kept on the pathes that at the laſt brought him to the top of the rock, and being there he went toward the broken Caſtle, where he perceived the other Image with the table that ſhe held in her left hand, the contents whereof he could no more underſtand then that of the Hermitage, wherefore without longer ſtaying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Notwithſtanding the cruel tyrant Love afterward obtained ſo great a Conqueſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, that he made him fall in love with her that he never had ſéen, nor never was in her company, as reading further in this Hiſtory you ſhall at large perceive. Then he laid hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſcabberd, and put the Sword in it, thanking God devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:57308:6"/>
for the grace he had obtained. After that he went divers times about the Tomb to ſée if he could open it without brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, but he perceived the chriſtal, from whence iſſued part of the brightneſs to be covered with another plate coloured like azure, ſo wonderfully wrought, that it would ſcarce be judged whether it were marble, mettal, or any other ſtuff: whereupon he left off his enterprize, and returned into the hall where the dead Serpent lay, but as then neither the Sword nor the Scabberd yielded any ſuch brightneſs as before they did, becauſe it was day: Then going out he went down again towards the Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage where he had left his Squire, who being melancholly and amazed at the long abſence of his maſter, (fearing ſome danger happened unto him was gone out of the Hermitage to ſéek him, and he had not travelled far, but he perceived him coming with the ſword by his ſide, whereat he made ſuch joy, that being yet far from him, he cryed out and ſaid; O my lord, bleſſed be God that hath given you ſo good a beginning whereat every man ſhall wonder. Friend (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) he hath yet done more for me then thou wouldeſt think, and with that he began from point to point to ſhew him the danger wherein he was, and being in that diſcourſe, it waxed dark even then when they arrived at the Hermitage: wherefore they determined not to travel any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that night, but layed them down under the next trées they came unto, ſtill ſpeaking of the ſtrangeneſs of the place: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <hi>Sergil</hi> being more abaſhed then before, could not refrain to ſay: As God help me Maſter, by good reaſon you may be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a better Knight then <hi>Amadis</hi> your father, that came into this place, and ſaw the Image at the Hermitage, the writing that ſtandeth upon the Arch of ſtone, the Serpent, the Sword that ſtuck in the gate where you found it, and the ſhining Tomb, yet durſt he never prove any of theſe adventures: and he ſaid true, for <hi>Amadis</hi> knew well by the Contents of the Letters written in Gréek, that thoſe adventures were ordained for his Son <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> and therefore undertook them not, but all others, onely <hi>Granſador</hi> and <hi>Urganda</hi> knew it not till then: but although <hi>Sergil</hi> thought to pleaſe his Maſter uſing ſuch words in his commendation, yet <hi>Eſplandian</hi> took it not ſo well, ſaying: I

pray thée <hi>Sergil</hi> never uſe ſuch ſpéeches, for if the proweſs and knightly adventures of my Father had béen as well employed to the advancing of the Chriſtian faith as they were to win and obtain honor in this world, I think his like would not be found, but having paſſed his youth in things ſo vain and tranſitory, doubtleſs his glory is the leſs, not that I preſume in any thing to accuſe him, and God forbid I ſhould, yet is he known in ſo many places to be ſo valiant a Knight, that whoſoever he be can ſecond him may well eſtéem himſelf happy among the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyeſt, wherefore I pray thée let us talk of other matters. Thus ſometimes talking and other whiles ſléeping, day began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, when they roſe up, taking their way towards the Sea-ſide, deſcending down the Rock, till they came where the two dumb men ſtayed for them, one within the ſhip, the other in a little bark, wherein <hi>Eſplandian</hi> entred, according to the ſign the dumb man had made, and <hi>Sergil</hi> went into the Serpent, and with that they departed, and the bark ſailed ſo ſwiftly, that in ſhort ſpace they left the ſight one of the other.

               </argument>
               <p>TEn days and as many nights together the Black Knight and the dumb man ſailed on the Sea, not knowing in what parts they were, for if he had enquired of his guide, it had béen but labor loſt: the eleventh day they diſcovered a great and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Iſland, where the Knight being wearied with the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity of the waves, deſired his guide to put his bark on ſhoar,
<pb facs="tcp:57308:7"/>
but he regarding not his words, thruſt it néer unto a high Rock, by nature cut in ſuch manner, that it ſéemed a wall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely made for the defence thereof: and the country was ſo full of woods and buſhes, that it might be eſtéemed unhabitable. Then the dumb man ſhewed him a path that led him up to the Rock, and made him a ſign to go thither, wherewith he iſſued out of the Barque, armed at all points, and began to mount up, the weather was then extream hot, whereby the Knight was ſo chaſed in his harneſs, that he was conſtrained to put off his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met and carry it in his hand, till he perceived a little Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage among the buſhes, and before it ſtood a high creſs, which pleaſed him well, not onely for the hope he had to finde ſome one of whom he might enquire in what country he was, but becauſe he was aſſured that there dwelt a Chriſtian, and with that he perceived a man apparelled like an Hermit, ſo old and withered that his long white beard hung down to his girdle, carrying in his hand a pitcher of water, that he had drawn out of a fountain not far from thence, and was paſsing by when the Knight ſpake unto him, ſaying: Father, God ſave you, which when the good man heard, he was in ſo great amaſe, that for fear his pitcher fell out of his hand and brake in pieces. Nevertheleſs by little and little he came to himſelf again, and perceiving him that ſpake unto him, anſwered and ſaid, My Son, it is now twenty years paſt ſithence I left the pleaſures of this world, and forſook my native ſoyl to obtain the grace of God, and that which moſt abaſheth me is, that ſince the time whereof I ſpeak I never found man that as yet ſaluted me in this manner, and I think verily you are a ſtranger in theſe countries, or elſe your ſpéech and apparel diſguiſeth you much Father (ſaid the Knight) true it is I am a ſtranger, brought hither by ſuch means, that I neither know the country where I am, nor any man or woman inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting therein, for you are the firſt creature that I met ſince I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived here, of whom I might enquire, aſſuring you that when I perceived this croſs it rejoyced my heart, for it is the arms of the Maſter that I ſerve. What? ſayed the Hermit, do you then know the vertue thereof? I, anſwered the Knight, that I do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well aſſured that upon the like croſs our Redéemer (whereof
<pb facs="tcp:57308:8"/>
I ſpeak) ſuffered death and paſsion. Alas ſaid the holy man, you ſay true, praiſed be his holy name, that once before I die hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me the grace to let me ſee a man of this ſide the Sea that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liveth in him, aſſuring you ſir Knight that you and I are onely the two creatures in this country that are chriſtians, for all the reſt are Pagans and Idolaters. And as he would have proceeded further, his ſpeech failed him, doubting y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he to whom he ſpake, was but a fantaſie or ſhadow of a man, but at the laſt he waxt bolder, &amp; in manner of conjuration asked him if he were a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal man or not? Mortal (anſwered the Knight) that I am for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and withal a ſinner, which diſpleaſeth me much, and if it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſheth you at this preſent to ſée me here, I am my ſelf no leſs abaſhed to ſee you: for without doubt the manner of my arrival in this country hath been ſuch and ſo ſtrange, that I can render you no reaſon thereof, but if you know the country wherein we are, I beſeech you good Father, tell it me to put me out of doubt. Gladly, (ſaid the Hermit) and with that he took him by the hand, and led him to his Hermitage, and there ſitting down together upon a log of wood, the old man began to ſpeak in this manner, and ſaid, Now ſir Knight, tell me I pray you what country man you are. Father (ſaid he) Great <hi>Britain</hi> is the country where in my youth I was born &amp; bred, I know not if ever you were acquainted therewith: How long is it ſaid the Hermit, ſince you came from thence? It is fiftéen days and more ſince I was there ſaid the Knight: Did you never know King <hi>Liſuart</hi> (ſaid the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit) that in my time raigned therein? Yes truly (ſaid the Knight) for I have ſeen him many times: how did he when you came from thence ſaid the Hermit? That can I not certainly ſhew ſaid the Knight, for he was loſt and led away from thence, but by whom or in what manner no man can tell, notwithſtanding the great pain and diligence divers of his Knights have uſed to finde him out. When the Hermit heard that, he ſeemed very penſive, which the Knight perceiving, thought in his mind that he could tell him ſome news, whereupon he began to behold him well in the face to ſee if he changed colour, with that the Hermit (that well perceived the Knights meaning) ſaid unto him. Truly Sir Knight, not without cauſe have I enquired ſo much touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> but before I will ſhew you my reaſon why,
<pb facs="tcp:57308:8"/>
you ſhall underſtand that I am of great <hi>Britain</hi> as well as you, where as yet the greateſt part of my kindred are living, whom I forſook at the ſame time that a Giant Lord of this country married with a Lady who as then I ſerved, and with her paſſed the Sea, not onely hoping to reap ſome reward of my former ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but (as yong men are moved) with a great deſire to ſée ſtrange countries, but it fortuned, that my Miſtriſs being forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of God, as ſoon as ſhe arrived in this country, left his holy law to receive the law of her husband, wherefore conſidering with my ſelf, that by reaſon as well of my natural weakneſs, as by often frequenting the company of theſe country men I might fall into ſome error, I determined to withdraw my ſelf into this place, wherein I have endured much pain &amp; miſery, to the great danger of my life, by reaſon of the controverſie betwéen the law of Ieſus Chriſt, which I hold, and the law of the Pagans that ſéek daily to deſtroy it, that without the favor of my miſtriſs that would not ſuffer them to diſpleaſe me, I had not lived ſo long as I have done among them, but when it pleaſeth God I wil depart hence, and return again into mine own country, now you have heard how I have hitherto lived, I pray you ſir Knight (ſaid he) ſhew me your adventures, and who hath brought you into this place from whence very hardly you will ever be able to return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but rather are in danger of moſt cruel death, or to indure the moſt horrible impriſonment that ever was heard of, which would grief me much, not onely for the great beauty and young years that I perceive to be in you, but for that you are my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive countryman. Father anſwered the Knight, you have done me great pleaſure to ſhew me the manner of your life and bringing up, nevertheleſs before I ſatisfie your requeſt, tell me (if it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth you) wherefore when you ſpake of King <hi>Liſuart</hi> you ſeemed ſo ſad, which made me conjecture that you know ſomething touching him. Son (ſaid the Hermit) you ſhall underſtand that a daughter of mine, ſervant to the Lady whereof I ſpake, not long ſince came hither to ſée me, and told me that her miſtriſs returning from great <hi>Britain,</hi> whither ſhe went to deliver a brother of hers out of priſon, brought with her very ſecretly a Knight of great eſtimation as ſhe ſaid, nevertheleſs I cannot aſſure you who it is: but as I have learned ſince, they ſay the two
<pb facs="tcp:57308:9"/>
Giants ſons were much pleaſed therewith, which maketh me doubt, conſidering the news you have ſhewed me touching King <hi>Luiſart,</hi> that he is moſt likely to be the man, for ſhe is ſo well ſéen in the art of Nigromancy and Magick, that oftentimes ſhe procureth miſchief unto thoſe that never offended her. And in what country are we now (ſaid the Knight?) You are between the Marches of Turky and Greece ſaid the Hermit, for this mountain parteth both the countries, but it is ſo ſtrong, not onely by nature, but by art, that neither of the two Princes of thoſe countries, what force ſoever they brought hither, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver win it. And now a Giant (ſon unto my Lady and miſtriſs) and one of the moſt ſtrongeſt and puiſſant Knights in the Eaſt parts, (as many of his neighbors, whoſe goods he hath by force uſurped, and that in deſpight of the Emperor, or any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting the ſame have proved) is Lord thereof. Where dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth be (ſaid the Knight?) Above upon the Rock (ſaid the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit) in a Caſtle which he hath moſt ſtrongly fortified, and is kept with all diligence and care by a Giant one of his brethren, with others, of as good condition as themſelves, and which is more, it is not poſsible to come neer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Caſtle, but by a little path<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way whereon the Sea continually beateth, at the end whereof there is a pair of ſtairs cut out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Rock, whereby you mount up till you come to an Iron-gate, where a villain, in whom the Lord of the Caſtle putteth his truſt, watcheth continually, for there is no other enterance, but onely the great gate that is defended with ſtrong Platforms and great Towers, in the middle where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is a door ſo ſtraight, that a man on horſeback can hardly enter therein, and that way moſt commonly thoſe of the Caſtle do iſſue forth. Before it be night, ſaid the Knight, I mean to ſee what manner of place it is, and if I can I will know who it is, that was ſo lately brought thither. God keep you from thence (ſaid the Hermit) for thereby you will either procure your own death, or at the leaſt perpetual impriſonment. Happen what may (ſaid the Knight) I will prove what fortune it ſhall pleaſe God to ſend me. That were but ill done of you (ſaid the Hermit) for that men are bound to imploy their forces onely in things that ſtand for reaſon and poſsibility, thereby to reap a benefit by their
<pb facs="tcp:57308:9"/>
labors, otherwiſe they are to be eſteemed deſperate fools, and not valiant and hardy Knights adventuring (without due reſpect) not onely their bodies, but their ſouls which are of greater price, and Chriſt himſelf hath by example plainly ſhewed it unto us, for when the devil came and tempted him, bidding him do certain things, which indeed (as he was Chriſt) were poſſible, but as he was man were impoſsible to do, he anſwered him that he ſhould not tempt the Lord his God. So my good Son (ſaid he) I would adviſe you to deſiſt from ſo unreaſonable an enterpriſe. You may preach what you will to perſwade me to the contrary (ſaid the Knight) but I muſt do that whereunto I am called, which is to prove my ſelf in thoſe adventures that in mans judgement ſeem impoſsible: otherwiſe thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> have foreſhewed of me, ſhould not onely have travelled in vain, but be eſteemed liars and fools. If then theſe ſayings be true, what greater honor can I obtain then bringing moſt wonderful adventures to an end, I may from henceforth thereby reſtrain the rage and fury of ſuch men as hurt, and do injury unto others, contrary to the Laws of God and man? And if they be found liars, I had rather they ſhould be reproved for their want of knowledge, then I accuſed of any point of cowardiſe. And if the worſt fall out, I will imploy my force againſt ſuch accurſed people, (members and miniſters of the devil) whom by the help of God I ſhall overcome: and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and am certainly perſwaded (that if I die in thoſe adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) he will receive my ſoul into his heavenly joy. The Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit marvelled much to hear the Black Knight ſpeak ſo wiſely, and with ſo great a courage, nevertheleſs the great beauty and yong years he perceived him to have, moved him to ſo great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the tears ran down his eyes, and therewith he ſaid, Ha good Knight, he in whom thou truſteſt, preſerve thee and ſend thee long life, and ſeeing thou art reſolutely determined to paſs forward, I pray thee defer the time for this night, for it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſo late, that although thou ſhouldeſt have time enough to get unto the gate before the Sun goeth down, yet ſhalt thou finde it ſhut as it is accuſtomed to be, whereupon the Knight kept the Hermit company till the next day in the morning.</p>

                  <p>How the black Knight went up the Rock, where by force of Arms he ſlew three Giants, and delivered King <hi>Luiſart</hi> out of priſon.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AT the Hermits requeſt the Knight ſtayed and bare him company all night, who entertained him in the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he could, where after they had ſupped, they layed them down upon a little ſtraw till day began to appear, when they roſe up, and the Knight having ſaid his prayers in the Chappel, being Armed at all points, took his leave of the Hermit, that brought him a great part of his way, and had gone further but he feared the Giants. Wherefore committing him to God, he took his leave and returned. Being gone, the Knight travelled ſo faſt, that having coaſted along the Sea-ſhore, and paſſed the ſide of a great and thick forreſt, be deſcended into the goodlieſt meddow that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was ſéen, from whence he perceived the Caſtle, ſcituated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the top of a high Rock, and making towards it, he came to a long bridge, finding no other way unto it, at the end whereof was a broad cauſie paved with ſtone, and the Sea beating con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually againſt the Towers, out of the windows he eſpyed two Knights, one as he thought was a Giant, the Ladies Son. Notwithſtanding he ſtayed not, but took his way on the left band, and mounting up the ſteps, came to a Marble-gate kept by a Knight all armed, that before he came to him cryed as loud as he could, ſaying, Thou accurſed wretch, the colour of thy ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor foreſheweth not ſo much ſorrow and grief as here thou ſhalt receive confuſion. What devil was he that ſent thée hither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo young? Mean time the Knight by little and little got up the Hill, making as if he heard him not, for he had work enough to look to himſelf, the way was ſtrait and uneaſie to paſs, and therefore he bare his Helmet under his arm. But when he approached the Gate, and heard the other continue in his bravery, he anſwered him and ſaid, He that is afraid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly threatneth a far off, as thou doeſt me, but if thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſt to know the cauſe of my coming, open me the Gate, and thou ſhalt ſee if I can ſatisfie thy deſire. With that the
<pb facs="tcp:57308:10"/>
Porter came down, and (while the Knight put on his Helmet) he opened the Gate, and looking out cryed with a loud voice, come in unhappy creature to the place where yet never any ſtranger had good entertainment. Then the black knight went in, and entred into a vault, mean time the gate was ſhut whereby the place ſeemed very dark, for there entred no light but onely by a little hole that came through the Rock, and as he paſſed forward, the Porter that was behind, ſtaying him, ſaid unto him, Villain, leave thy armor here, and I will bring thee where the Lords of the Caſtle ſhall reward thee according to thy deſerts. It were better (ſaid the knight) without ſo much trouble to bring me thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther e'n as I am, and I will follow thee. But I will not (ſaid he) leſt I loſe too much by thee, for then my companion will have thy Armor, which by right is mine, and with that he lifted up his hatchet, thinking to cleave his head, whereat the black knight ſtept back, and with his Sword gave him ſuch a blow, that he overthrew him on the ground, and ſtepping upon him, thruſt him into the body, and as he had done, there entered at the Gate (that went out of the vault) a villain all armed, who thinking to ſpeak to the Porter, with a rude and churliſh voice, ſaid, <hi>Argantes,</hi> why ſtayeſt thou ſo long to bring up that accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed wretch that even now entred at the Gate? Be content a while (ſaid the black Knight) I will be there ſoon enough both for thée and thoſe that ſent thée, if the Gates be open. With that the villain perceived himſelf to be deceived, for he eſpyed <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantes</hi> dead upon the ground, wherefore without longer ſtaying he turned his back, and pulled the door after him, left the knight ſhut into the vault, whereat he was abaſhed, fearing to be fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for want of meat, but it fell out otherwiſe, for not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he ſaw the gate opened, whereat there entred a Giant arned all in gréen, who perceiving the party dead, and the Knight that had ſlain him ſtanding by him, was in ſuch a rage, that he ſaid unto him, Thou curſed wretch, I am much abaſhed how thou haſt thus intangled thy ſelf within this place, from whence while thou liveſt thou ſhalt never be able to eſcape, but when thou haſt indured a long and moſt hard impriſonment, ſhalt be conſtrained to end thy miſerable days with a thouſand cruel torments that are prepared for thee.

I aſſure thee I loved this dead Knight as well as I love my ſelf, and now I finde him in this manner ſlain before mine eyes, yet art thou not afraid to boaſt thereof: By my head (ſaid he) thou ſhalt dearly buy it. Behold I pray thee, anſwered the Knight, how thy unhappy fortune followeth thee at once, here before thy face thou ſeeſt thy friend dead, and by the ſame means thou ſhalt likewiſe looſe the ſoul out of thy body, which the devil hath waited for ſince thou firſt beganſt to lead an evil life.

And as the Knight ſtepped forth, he met two Squires that came to ſee the Combate, who perceiving the Knight with his Sword bloody in his hand, asked him what was become of their guard.

in the world, and in deſpight of them to enter thus far within the Caſtle, but of one thing am I well aſſured, that what pain or torment ſoever I ſhall cauſe thée to indure, I cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of the leaſt wrong and injury I have received at thy hands. Thou brutiſh &amp; unreaſonable beaſt (ſaid the Knight) thou art ſurely worſe then he of whom thou ſpeakeſt, for that he being already judged of God, hath neither mean to repent his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor hope of ſalvation, but thou to whom it hath pleaſed God to give ſence and reaſon to know both good and evil, doeſt ſtill perſevere in thy wickedneſs, making of vice a vertue, in ſuch manner that by good right I may better tearm thee a devil then thoſe that are wearied and wax melancholly to have ſo long attended for thy accurſed ſoul, which I will ſhortly ſend them if thou come forth into this court, or let me enter in. Then ſtay (ſaid <hi>Frerion</hi>) and thou ſhalt ſée how I will teach thée to preach in other ſort, and with that he ſhut the door and went in to arm him, mean time the black Knight ſat down upon a marble ſtone, and he had not reſted long, but the Giant came again, who brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging a great Cimiter upon his ſhoulder, would have iſſued at the gate, when the Knight ſpake unto him, ſaying. Stay a little I pray thée before thou comeſt forth, and grant me one requeſt which in right thou canſt not well deny me, for although neither courteſie nor any part thereof did ever lodge within thy breaſt, that habit of Knighthood wherewith thou art inveſted, ought more to move thée to humanity then thy nature of it ſelf affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. Ask what thou wilt (ſaid the Giant) and it may be thou ſhalt be refuſed. Both thou &amp; I (ſaid the Knight) are now on foot, I pray thée then let us fight in the other Court, that thoſe of thy Caſtle may behold the paſtime: which he ſaid to the end that if he overcame his enemies as he doubted not thereof, they ſhould not ſhut him out. By my head (ſaid the Giant) at the firſt I thought thou wouldeſt have asked mercy at my hands, which would not much avail thée: but ſéeing thy requeſt is no other, I am content to grant it, although a means to flie away were (much more advantage unto thée which theſe high walls will not permit thee, if thou be once incloſed within them: Thou ſpeakeſt ſaid the black Knight) as thy nature yieldeth, and I as vertue

bindeth me, for the reſt let God work his will. Come in then (ſaid <hi>Frerion</hi>) and defend thy ſelf from me if thou canſt. With that the black Knight entred into a fair court paved with white Marble, all galleried about and ſupported with Pillars of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire, in the middeſt whereof ſtood the portal that entered into the houſe, where an old Lady accompanied of divers yong gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen ſtood looking forth, to whom the Giant went, and knée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on his knée, ſaid unto her: Madam, I moſt humbly beſéech you, that neither for good nor evil which may happen unto me in fighting with this Knight, not one of your houſe be ſo bold to help or favor me in any ſort, for I my ſelf will put him to death with this my trenchant blade, and riſing up again holding his Shield before him with his Cimiterre in his hand, he marched towards his enemy, who having God on his ſide (to whom he recommended himſelf) ſtood ready to receive him. Then there began ſuch a Combate betwéen them, that their blows ſéemed two Smiths forging upon their Anvils, ſeeming like fire that the wind kindled in the air, and ſurely the black Knight had ſped but hardly at that time had it not been for the Armor <hi>Urganda</hi> gave him, that could not be cut by any weapon, and for the good Sword he conquered in the Rock of the Enchantreſs, wherewith he ſtroke not one blow, but he drew blood on the Giant <hi>Frerion,</hi> who nevertheleſs did marvellouſly both defend himſelf and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayl his enemy, but by evil fortune as he thought to ſtrike the Knight on the right arm, he ſtarted back, and ſtepping forwards again, gave the Giant ſuch a blow upon the Helmet that he cut away a great piece thereof, together with the buckle that made it faſt, but although the blow was marvellous great, and in a manner incredible, yet was not the Giant any thing therewith abaſhed, but ſtill ſhewed himſelf as freſh as if he had not fought all the day long: Nevertheleſs the blood in ſuch abundance iſſued out of his body, that the white pavement of the Court was changed into red, and therewith he grew ſo weak, that it might eaſily be judged he had the worſt, whereby he ſtill began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, ſeeking onely to defend himſelf from his enemies blows, whereat the old Lady that beheld them, conſidering her Sons extreamity, cryed out and ſaid, Alas my childe, is it poſsible
<pb facs="tcp:57308:12"/>
I ſhould ſee thee murthered before my face, and therewith in great haſte ſhe ran thither, thinking to part them, but it was too late, for as ſhe began to go towards them, the Giant fell dead on the ground with two blows that the black Knight gave him, one upon the head where he was unarmed, the other right in the middle of his leg, wherewith he cut it from his body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the old Lady was ſo grieved that ſhe ſwooned in the place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by her Gentlewomen carryed from thence into her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where they layed her on a bed, curſing him that was the cauſe thereof, nevertheleſs he followed them to the chamber door, where the old woman (being revived) perceiving him to enter, began again to lament and mourn, and ſhedding great abundance of tears, ſhe ſaid unto him: Alas thou cruel knight, the onely bereaver of all my joy and felicity, art thou not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied yet? But wilt thou likewiſe have my life and my Sons both? Then I pray thee with ſpéed either execute thy will or elſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from hence, and take what thou thinkeſt good, permitting me to live the reſt of my miſerable days in ſorrow and care, with theſe poor women: but all her intent was to make him enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the chamber, which was ſo inchanted, that no man could paſs the threſhold of the door, but preſently he loſt all his ſences and fell down upon the ground, as if he were dead, but little did the inchantment avail her againſt the black knight, becauſe the ſhining Sword had ſuch a property in it, that no enchantment whatſoever could hurt the bearer thereof. Therefore the Knight hearing the ſorrow the old Lady made, he went into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſpeaking courteouſly unto her, and ſaid, Madam me thinks you ſhould take the offence I have committed on your behalf, in much better part, conſidering ſuch hazards are common un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Knights, deſiring to win honor, and therefore I pray you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe your ſorrow and ſhew me the Knight you brought hither out of great <hi>Britain.</hi> When the old Lady perceived him ſo far within the Chamber without let, and that he deſired to ſée the King, ſhe being as it were out of her wits, cryed as loud as ſhe could, and ſaid, alas unhappy wretch that I am, what have I done, for thinking to revenge another mans death, I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the deſtruction of mine own children, and therewith ſhe
<pb facs="tcp:57308:13"/>
ſighed in ſuch manner as if her heart would burſt within her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and lamenting the abſence of her other Son, ſaid: Alas <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troco,</hi> where art thou now? What happy fortune hath thus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated thée from thy brother and me? Surely when thou heareſt of his death, and at thy return ſhalt finde another Lord of this caſtle, I am in doubt thou wilt not have the patienre to put up ſo great an injury, but thinking to revenge thy ſelf I fear this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil will handle thée in the like ſort he hath done the reſt, for ſure he is no mortal man, for if he were he had found more reſiſtance in this place then he hath done. Then ſpeaking unto the Knight ſhe asked him if he knew the man ſhe held in priſon, I truly (ſaid he) it is King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> whereof I am right ſorry, being well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that Kings elected of God, (as he is) for the government of his people, ought not to be uſed in that manner. Wherefore I would have you ſhew me where be is, otherwiſe, I will do worſe then I have hitherto done. I know not (ſaid ſhe) who thou art, nor by what means thou haſt ſo great power, but I am well aſſured and I would never have thought that twenty ſuch Knights (as once this day I did eſtéem thée) could ever have attained to the atchieving of ſo great an enterprize, and much leſs to have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood my art as thou haſt done, ſo that conſidering thereof, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this thy power procéedeth from him in whom in my young years I did once believe, and ſince that have forſaken him, to follow the works of the common enemy of all mankinde, who according to his natural inſtinction, hath juſtly rewarded me to my deſert: therefore it were but folly to deny thee any thing, that art ſo ſurely defended by him to whom all things are obedient. Follow me then (ſaid ſhe) and I will ſhew thee the king, but as I think, it is not he thou ſeekeſt. And with that ſhe roſe up and went into a dark chamber, the knight following her: then ſhe opened an Iron-gate, and ſaid unto him go in, and there ſhalt thou find the priſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Lady (ſaid the knight) if it were to fight I would not fail to do your commandment, but if by ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I ſhould be ſhut in priſon, you would laugh at me that I had no more wit but to put my truſt in you, wherefore go you in firſt, that whatſoever happeneth, you may have your part, I ſee well (ſaid the Lady) that my labor is in vain, and all my art is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

in reſpect of thee, therefore I am content to do thy will, but we have no light to ſee. Care you not for that (ſaid he) for I will provide you light, and with that he pulled of the taffata that covered the ſcabberd of his Sword, whereby there was ſo great a brightneſs in the place, as if the Sun had ſhone there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Then they deſcended into a Cave, where the Knight percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved King <hi>Liſuart</hi> lie upon a couch of ſtraw, with a great collar of Iron about his neck, and fetters on his legs, whereby he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured no little pain, whereat he was ſo grieved, that for ſorrow the tears ran down his eyes, yet would he not diſcloſe himſelf unto him, neither once utter what he thought, but without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelf known, ſaid unto him Noble King, you have been overlong within this filthy place, riſe up I pray you and follow me. When the King heard him ſpeak in that manner, he made no other account but to end his days at that time, wherewith he could not refrain to weep, and ſpeaking unto the old Lady, asked her if ſhe knew him: For (ſaid he) ſince I entred into this place, I never ſaw any Knight nor any one that ſpake unto me, but that little ſuſtenance I had was let down at a hole from the top of this dungeon. Then ſhe anſwered him, and in great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite ſaid, Thou accurſed King, if I had not known thee, I would never have taken pains to fetch thee ſo far, from hence as I have done, curſed be the time when firſt I took it upon me, for thou one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly art the cauſe of my great ſorrow, and the ſole inſtrument of my bereaved joys. In faith Lady (ſaid the King) I know not what you mean, &amp; am very ſorry for your heavineſs, for I never ſought but to do honor and pleaſure unto all Ladies and Gentlewomen that deſired the ſame, and for them have I oftentimes enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed many dangerous adventures, to the great peril and hazard of my life, and if it hath happened otherwiſe unto you, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unknown to me and wholly againſt my will, wherefore I beſeech you be not offended with me, but tell me where I am, and in whoſe power I now remain a priſoner in ſo great miſery, for by my ſoul I know it not, neither can I ſo much as conceive which way I came into this place; onely I remember that to ſecond a Gentlewoman that a villain would have forced, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a tent, but what happened unto me after that I know

I pray you then Lady (ſaid he) unloſe his Irons, and help me to lead him up, with that ſhe took the keys out of her pocket, and opened the locks of his chains, whereby the King roſe up upon his féet, and embracing the Knight, ſaid unto him, What great good or pleaſure ſir Knight did I ever do you, whereby you ſhould purchaſe this liberty unto me? By my ſoul I ſwear, that beſides the honor you have obtained in this place, you have ſo much bound me unto you, that during my life I ſhall never forget your courteſie, wherefore if you love me let me know your name. Noble King (ſaid the Knight) whoſoever I am, I account my ſelf happy if in any ſort I may be able to do you ſervice, as for the reſt pardon me if it pleaſeth you, and let us go out of this Cave, thanking God, that oftentimes ſendeth

The King perceiving well by the Knights words that he deſired not to be known, and for the ſame cauſe kept his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit on his head, therefore he determined not to move him any more, but with that they went all thrée out of the Cave, and came into a goodly hall, when the Sun began to go down.</p>

               <p>KIng <hi>Luiſart,</hi> the black Knight, and the Lady being entred into the hall, as they looked out at the windows into the Sea, there entred a Gentlewoman, and doing reverence unto the Lady, ſhe ſaid, Madam, your Son <hi>Matroco</hi> with his Ships is even now arrived at the foot of the Kock, and with him great numbers of other veſſels, that he hath taken upon the Seas, What is your pleaſure to ſay unto him? When the Lady heard her ſhe waxed pale, and with tears in her eyes, anſwered her and ſaid, I would to God he were as far from hence as he is néer: for my heart giveth me he will ſpéed in the like manner that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have done before him. And as ſhe ſpake, King <hi>Luiſart</hi> and the Knight looked into the ſea, and perceiving the Giants Fléet ſurging on the ſhoar out of wind and weather, among the which they knew <hi>Elizabeth Libee</hi> his nephew, and divers others that were bound in Chains, making great ſorrow, but none of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocos</hi> men durſt ſet foot on land, having already béen advertiſed by ſome of the Caſtle, of the great misfortune happened there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and for the ſame cauſe ſtayed ſo long without, till the Giant eſpyed at the windows the Knight and the King looking upon them, wherewith in a great rage he cryed unto the black Knight whom he perceived all armed, and ſaid unto him: Thou accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſlave is it thou that ſo cowardly hath ſlain my uncle, my brother, and the porter of the Caſtle? When the Knight heard
<pb facs="tcp:57308:15"/>

By all my Gods (ſaid <hi>Matroco</hi>) fortune fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voreth thee too much, when at my arrival I finde thee armed with the walls of this my Caſtle, for if I had thee here upon the ſhore, I would ſoon ſend thee fiſhing into the Sea as I have done many other raſh and bold fools like thy ſelf, that haſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed without cauſe to inforce my Caſtle, but if I continue here ten years together, I will never depart hence till I have thee in my hands, then ſhalt thou know how I uſe to handle ſuch as thou art. Stay a while (ſaid the black Knight) there is much more difference between ſaying and doing, then there is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of place betwéen thée and me. Thy threatnings make me more aſſured, wherefore now I fear thée leſſer then I did before, and that thou mayeſt well know it to be ſo, take thy choice, whether I ſhall come down to ſight with thée, or thou come up to me. Then ſhalt thou plainly ſée to whom God will give the victory, either to thée that truſteſt in thy own ſtrength, or to me, that truſt onely in him. The greateſt oxen and the fatteſt bulls are oftentimes brought unto the ſlaughter as well as leſſer beaſts.

In this manner did the Giant lament over the body of <hi>Arcalaus</hi> his dead Vncle, not moving from thence, till at laſt he perceived the black Knight that ſtood to hear him, wherewith being ſomewhat aſhamed he marched towards him, thinking without hinderance to enter into the dungeon, but he found the black Knight at the gate that boldly thruſt him back, and ſaid unto him, Thou brutiſh

No (ſaid the Knight) but beholding thy countenance, it ſeemeth thou wouldeſt enter by authority, and therewith ſtepping aſide, he ſaid: Now come in, and do what thou canſt. When the old woman (with whom King <hi>Luiſart</hi> talked) perceived them ready to fight, in great fear ſhe ran out of the Hall, and fell down at her Sons feet, crying out and ſaid, Alas <hi>Matroco,</hi> I pray thee, and by the duty a childe oweth unto the mother, I command thee not to enter into this Combate, for thou knoweſt well that of all thy brethren, thou art onely left alive, wherewith my heart is ſo grieved, that had it not been for the love I bear thee, thou hadſt found me now at thy return in as pitiful eſtate as thou ſeeſt thy brother <hi>Frerion:</hi> neither is there any woman at this preſent living in the world, that ought (with better reaſon) to wiſh for death then I.

you muſt conceive and think with your felf that I anſwer you as it becometh me, prefeirving mine honor before your tears, wherefore I beſeech you ſuffer me to take the ſmall vengeance I can upon the villain that hath ſo much offended me. <hi>Matroco</hi> (ſaid the Knight) thou reckoneſt before thine hoſt, I would not for al the gold in the world, loſe ſuch an occaſion offered as I now have, both for mine honor and advantage. Believe me, that neither thy mothers tears, nor the duty thou oweſt unto her (as being her childe) can by any means prolong the end of thee or me, if without diſſimulation thou doſt not by oath promiſe and aſſure me to live in as good ſort from this time forwards as in times paſt thou haſt lived wickedly. Wherefore it were better for thée to make me know by effect the Proweſs thou vaunteſt thy ſelf to have, and for me to let thée ſée the courteſie, which it may be thou ſhalt finde at my hands if I overcome thée. When the Lady perceived that her prayers could take no place, ſhe left them, and the two Knights began to run one upon the other ſo bravely, and with ſuch fury, that King <hi>Luiſart</hi> behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, thought he never ſaw ſo cruel a battel, and the which abaſhed him more was, that he could not preſume how or in what manner the black Knight had found him in ſo ſtrange a place, and yet he knew him not: ſometime he thought him to be <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> but when he remembred the love he bare unto the Lady <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> that he had newly married, he was otherwiſe perſwaded, and likewiſe he remembred very well the Combates he had ſéen <hi>Amadis De Gaule</hi> make at <hi>Windſore</hi> againſt <hi>Dardan le Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be,</hi> and after that with <hi>Ardan Canile,</hi> wherein he uſed all his forces, yet were they not comparable to thoſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> black Knights: who as then found himſelf as freſh and well diſpoſed to fight as if he had not fought all the day before. Again when he thought it to be his nephew <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> for that <hi>Urganda</hi> had foreſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many wonderful things of him, he was ſoon diſſwaded from that opinion, by reaſon be left him with the Queen his Mother, not once ſéeking to receive the order of Knighthood, and although that ſince his departure out of <hi>Britain</hi> he might have obtained that honor, yet did he eſtéem it impoſsble for <hi>Eſplandian</hi> to do ſo valiantly at the firſt. Further, <hi>Urganda</hi> had always
<pb facs="tcp:57308:17"/>
propheſied of him that the firſt valiant acts he ſhould atchieve, ſhould be renowned and ſpoken of by his ſtrange and fearful na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation in the great Serpent, wherein he ſhould be imbarqued, and for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> black knight he knew he arrived there in a little Barque unfurniſhed, whereby he eſteemed it unlikely to be his nephew <hi>Eſplandian.</hi> But he thought he never had ſéen ſo valiant and and hardy a Knight, for the longer he fought, the more he weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and labored <hi>Matroco.</hi> Nevertheleſs he continued fighting for the ſpace of two hours together before it could be judged who ſhould have the victory, but in the end the Giant feeling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wounded in ſo many places (his armor altogether broken, and his ſhield half cloven in two) began to miſtruſt his own force. Wherefore ſtepping back he ſtayed his hand, and ſaid: Knight I pray thee let us breath our ſelves a while, and hear what I will offer thee, which cannot be other then to thy honor and advantage. With that the Knight ſtood ſtill, and <hi>Matro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> began to ſpeak, ſaying: I wonder (ſir Knight) what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thee to venture in this manner upon this Rock, wherein never any but thy ſelf durſt enterpriſe to come during my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers life, neither yet ſithence that by his death I have been Lord thereof, and beſides this thy enterpriſe, wherein thou haſt done the thing that all others feared to do before thee, thou haſt alſo ſlain three of my friends, whereof two of them as I think were the beſt Knights in their time living on the earth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I have juſt cauſe to hate thee more then any man living. But when I call to minde that thou haſt done therein like a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and hardy Knight, I have ſome reaſon to pardon thee, and to eſteem thee for one of the valianteſt Champions that ever I ſaw in all my life, although I have both proved and vanquiſhed many others longer practiſed in arms, and ſtronger then thy ſelf. Wherefore if the onely cauſe of thy arrival in this place was to deliver the King that looketh on us, I am content thou take and lead him hence in ſafety, and for the ſame cauſe likewiſe I quit thee of the combate, upon condition that without longer ſojour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning here, thou ſhalt preſently depart out of this caſtle that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth unto me.

Nevertheleſs if thou wilt acknowledge thy former life, and of a wicked wretch (as thou haſt always lived) become a vertuous Knight, and as thou haſt béen moſt cruel and inhumane, become courteous and pitiful, forſaking thy vain and fooliſh faith to believe in my God, who is the moſt true and mighty Lord of all Lords, I will not onely pardon thée the Combate whereof thou haſt the worſt, but will leave thée thy caſtle frée unto thy ſelf, &amp; ſo wil be thy friend, upon condition nevertheleſs, that from hence forth both thou &amp; I ſhall imploy our forces to overthrow and deſtroy all thoſe, that (as thy ſelf) do walk in darkneſs, from whence (if thou wilt believe me) thou ſhalt come out.

And therewith he pulled away the pieces of his Shield that hung about his neck, and threw them
<pb facs="tcp:57308:18"/>
on the ground, and taking his ſword in both his hands, he ſtruck at the black Knight, thinking to cleave his head, but he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſtroke, ſtepped under the blow, and cloſed with the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, whereby the ſword paſſing over his head, hir upon the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with ſo great force, that it brake in pieces, and therewith the pummel fell out of his hand, ſo that the two Knights being cloſed together, could not hurt one the other but with their fiſts or pummels of their ſwords, whereby the black Knight much grieved the Giant, before he could finde the means to recover the handle of his ſword, but in the end he found means to unloſe himſelf from the Knight, and as he recoiled back, ſhunning the fury of his enemy, the old woman ſéeing her ſon in ſo great danger, went between them, and wéeping moſt bitterly, ſaid unto the Knight: Alas Gentleman, if ever you came of woman, or have compaſsion of a poor widows eſtate, I beſéech you for the honor of him in whom you believe, to pity my miſery, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me this onely ſon, content your ſelf with the death of thoſe, that moſt cruelly you have ſlain before my face. Lady (ſaid the Knight) then cauſe him to ask mercy, and he ſhall finde it in me, otherwiſe you labor but in vain. To ask mercy of thée (ſaid the Giant) I can never be diſhonored thereby, knowing it by experience to be moſt true, that ſuch power and ſtrength as I I finde in thée, cometh not from thy ſelf, but proceedeth and is onely cauſed by the favor of thy God, for without his help thou hadſt no more béen able to endure againſt me, than ſtraw againſt the flaming fire, therefore it were great folly in me to fight both againſt God and man, but I had rather (perceiving my end to approach) ask him mercy and forgiveneſs, then believe any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in thoſe in whom I have hitherto put my truſt, whereof I am right ſorry, ſo that whether I fight, or fight not, or whether I live or die, I proteſt and make a vow from henceforth, never to worſhip other then Ieſus Chriſt thy Lord and Maſter.

And it pleaſeth your Grace (ſaid he) once this day I did not think he would have had ſo much

néed of my help as he now hath: But as I underſtand by a Knight that I méet going down the hill, he is in great danger of his life: Nevertheleſs for the honor of him that commanded me to help him, I will do the beſt I can. I pray you do ſo (ſaid the King.) Then maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> cauſed <hi>Matroco</hi> to be ſoftly layed upon his bed, and being unarmed ſearched his wounds, and perceiving them to be deadly, would not for that time do any thing unto them but ſtanch their bléeding, leaving the reſt till he had ſlept, wherein he was newly fallen. In the mean time King <hi>Luiſart</hi> not forgetting what maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> at his coming in had ſaid unto him, aſked him what was become of the black Knight: and it pleaſeth your Grace (ſaid he) as we entred into the Caſtle, I met him going ſecretly from hence, and not minding to return again. By Saint <hi>Mary</hi> (ſaid the King) have I received ſo great aid at his hands, and am I ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, that he ſhould depart from hence without knowing him? Truly I am ſorry I ſtayed here to ſée what would become of <hi>Matroco,</hi> if I had not, I would ſurely have followed him, and with much importunity have craved his name. Maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (ſaid he) will you upon your faith tell me truly whether you know him or not? If it be ſo, if you will do me any pleaſure, hide it no longer from me, for I never had ſo great deſire to know any Knight, not onely for the aid he hath done me, but for the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant enterpriſe at this preſent atchieved by him. Your grace ſhal pardon me if it pleaſeth you, ſaid maſter <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> for it is true that I know him wel, but if I tell you any more, I ſhould do him wrong, for he hath expreſſely forbidden me to do it. I ſée well (ſaid the King) you will but increaſe the deſire I have to know him, &amp; that is worſe, by the ſame means bereave me of all hope ever to ſée him again. With that they entred into the Hal, where they méet <hi>Arcabonne</hi> half dead with ſorrow, whom the King in courteous manner prayed to ſtay a while, asking her how her ſon did. He doth (ſaid ſhe) as one in whom I have as little hope of life as of the other that lyeth dead in the court, &amp; to ſay y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, it ſéemeth that fortune hath wholly bent her ſelf againſt me, not ceaſing continually to heap ſorrow upon ſorrow to make me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate. Notwithſtanding I know full well how to be revenged,
<pb facs="tcp:57308:20"/>
and that is, in diſpight of her and her cruelties to bereave my ſelf of life whereof ſhe ſhall loſe her power, which by good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I cannot well prolong, ſéeing ſhe hath not ſpared me one hour of reſt ſince ſhe firſt began, ſtill playing her part in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting me, but of all other my miſfortunes, none hath grieved me ſo much as the force of this Knight, by whoſe power (ſaid ſhe unto the King) I ſée thée now delivered out of my hands, and from the cruel torments I had prepared for thée, if accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed fortune had not withſtood them. Madam (ſaid the King) I pray you declare unto me the cauſe of this your great malice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, and whether at any time I have done you wrong or injury whereby I ſhould deſerve it: that will I ſhew thée, ſaid <hi>Arbaconne,</hi> not therein to do thée pleaſure, but rather to grieve thée more when thou ſhalt know and underſtand that I was born and bred in the ſame country, wherein to my great deſpight thou haſt raigned overlong, for there I and <hi>Arcalaus</hi> my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by father and mother, were doth begotten and brought up in the art of Nigromancy, which oftentimes we have practiſed and put in effect, therewith to torment divers perſons that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did offend us. In the which art, as age and knowledge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, I growing very expert, in the end became acquainted with <hi>Cartadaque,</hi> as then Lord of this Caſtle, and with him I grew in ſo great familiarity, that he married me, and with him ever ſithence have dwelt here in this Caſtle, where not long after I was delivered of a Son called <hi>Lindoraque,</hi> after that of another named <hi>Matroco,</hi> that now lyeth in this bed, and laſtly of the third called <hi>Frerion,</hi> whom thou haſt ſlain, and my brother alſo, that went to help <hi>Argantes</hi> the Porter of this Caſtle.

But by tract of time I found it otherwiſe, for by little and little ſhe hath wholly changed my joy into moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſorrow, and wilt thou know how?

Yet fortune not contenting her ſelf with this miſchief, prepared me a woſe, for my husband (who for his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and proweſs was feared and redoubted throughout all <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi>) was cruelly ſlain by the ſame murtherer of <hi>Lindo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raque,</hi> upon the ſame day the battel was fought, if thou canſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it, whereby ever ſithence I remained a widdow with my other Sons as then very young and tender of age, with whom I have paſſed the greateſt part of my days moſt extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wéeping and lamenting with continual ſadneſs, which had been more grievous unto me, had it not béen for the hope I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of their valour and proweſs.

While <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabonne</hi> made this long diſcourſe, the King that ſtill beheld her in the face, remembred well it was ſhe to whom he ſpake in the pavillion, wherefore he ſaid unto her, In good faith Madam I now believe you better then at the firſt, yet me thinketh you do me wrong to make me bear the burthen of another mans of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.

Alas (ſaid ſhe) that which I moſt feared, and ever ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence yeſterday moſt aſſuredly expected, is fallen out: and as ſhe uttered thoſe words, ſhe pulled out a naked ſword that ſhe bare under her arm, wherewith ſhe meant to kill the King But as fortune would, he perceived the blow coming, and ſtepped aſide, and with the force of the blow the ſword hitting upon the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, fell out of the old womans hands, wherewith the King ſtepped upon it, and when he ſtooped to take up, <hi>Arcabonne</hi> perceiving the chamber door where maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was, to be open, ſhe ran thither, and threw her ſelf out of a window into the ſea: the King followed her not, but went into the chamber
<pb facs="tcp:57308:22"/>
where <hi>Matroco</hi> lay, and perceiving him to be dead, came forth again into the Hall, where he met maſter <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that told him news of <hi>Arcabonnes</hi> death. In good truth (ſaid he) there is no extremity like to that of a woman, behold, I pray you with what fury ſhe was poſſeſſed, for as I iſſued out of the Chamber, I met her, and thinking with fair ſpéeches and good perſwaſions to comfort her, ſhe failed not much to kill me with this ſword that I have in my hand: and as they beheld it, the King knew it to be the ſame he wore when he was inchanted, which pleaſed him ſo well, that he ſaid, Ha good ſword, the beſt and faithfulleſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion that ever man had! how many victories have I had by thy means, and what combates and adventures have I brought to an end by thy help? And by great misfortune having loſt thée, thou kneweſt me, for being in a mad womans hands, that with thée would have ſlain me, thou haſt not onely denied her that favor, but haſt fallen out of her hands to return again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that never (while his arm is able to wield thée) will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thée. Now (ſaid he to <hi>Libee</hi>) if we chance to be aſſaulted, we have wherewith to defend us. Truly (ſaid maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) I believe all thoſe that could hurt us in this place, are either dead or fled away, wherefore I am of opinion in the morning to bury them that are ſlain, mean time expecting ſome means whereby we may return into your Graces country, we will enquire what is become of the black Knight that you ſo much deſire to know. You ſhall do well (ſaid the King) and therewith each man went to reſt till the morning, that maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and others of his company went to bury the porter &amp; the reſt of the dead Knights, among the which they knew <hi>Arcalaus</hi> the Inchanter, that not fiftéen days before had arrived in the Caſtle; for at his delivery out of priſon, being advertiſed of King <hi>Luiſart's</hi> ſudden depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he ſuſpected his ſiſter <hi>Arcabonne</hi> had ſtollen him away, and therefore came expreſly to the Caſtle armed in gréen as you have heard, and although maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had ſéen him oftentimes before, yet at the firſt fight he doubted it was he, conſidering where not long before he had left him, wherefore he ſent to tell the King, that preſently came to ſée him, who knew him well, yet I thought (ſaid he) he had ſtill béen priſoner in <hi>the Ferm Iſle:</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:57308:22"/>
And it pleaſeth your Grace (ſaid maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) he was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered from thence before my departure, and therewith ſhewed him the means how, as it is at large declared in the end of our Fourth Book. Behold (ſaid the King) how great are the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God! let his body be put into ſome cold place, for I am well aſſured that his ſoul ſhall endure more heat than ever it had in this world.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>ARcalaus</hi> and the reſt being buried, King <hi>Luiſart</hi> went into his Chamber, and as he looked into the ſea, he could not ſée the ſhips that <hi>Matroco</hi> brought with him, wherefore enquiring which way they went, he was certified, that when <hi>Arcabonne</hi> threw her ſelf out of the window into the Sea, they took up her dead body, and laying it in their Veſſels, hoiſed ſayls, and put to ſea. Let them go to the devil (ſaid the King) and we to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, if there be any thing to eat: your dinner is ready (ſaid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) when it pleaſeth your Grace to ſit down: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the meat was brought in, and the King did eat with a good appetite, but he had taken ſo little reſt the night before, that as he ſate at the Table he fell aſléep. Wherefore riſing up, he laid him down on his Bed, commanding his men not to wake him, wherewith maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was well pleaſed, knowing that in the mean time he might have convenient leiſure to go unto <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> as he had promiſed, whereupon he departed ſecretly out of the Caſtle, and going down the hill, went ſo long that he came to the Hermitage, where he found the Hermite and the dumb man ſitting at the door, and he ſaluting them, asked if the black Knight were there? the Hermit ſaid no: but the dumb man made ſigns that he ſhould go into the Chamber, which he did, where he found him very melancholy lying upon a bed. But when he perceived maſter <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> he took him by the hand, and ſaid: My good friend maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> you are welcome hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tell me I pray you how you left <hi>the Ferm Iſle,</hi> in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb facs="tcp:57308:23"/>
to ſerve <hi>Matroco</hi> and his barbarous companions? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he laughed, for the Giant had tyed him to a chain, and made him row in his Gallies as other ſlaves did. My Lord (ſaid maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) when you received the Order of Knighthood, and that King <hi>Bruneo, Quedragant,</hi> and all our company that were as then with your father <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> ſlept by means of the melodious noiſe of nine Trumpets that ſounded on the ſhoar, <hi>Graſinde</hi> my Miſtriſs ſent me on a meſſage to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>Saluder</hi> her brother, to certifie him of her Marriage with the Prince of <hi>Sanſuegue,</hi> wherefore I imbarqued my ſelf, and had ſo good a winde, that in ſhort time after I arrived at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> where I found the Emperor, that took great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to hear me diſcourſe what had happened ſithence the return of <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> his Nephew. And the next day when I meant to return, the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine,</hi> who in my minde is the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulleſt Princeſs living at this time, ſent for me, moſt inſtantly deſiring me that in the preſence of Quéen <hi>Minoreſſe,</hi> with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Ladies and Gentlewomen, I would ſhew her what I had heard touching the Knight with the gréen ſword. For (ſaid ſhe) although that now we underſtand he is named <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> yet will we not change his other name, till ſuch time he ſendeth us ſome other of his linage, or elſe return himſelf to do us ſervice, according to his promiſe. Then I ſhewed them of the ſtrangeneſs of the Ark of Lovers, the ſingularities of the Iſle, whereof they never had heard, the loſs of King <hi>Luiſart,</hi> the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how you received the Order of Knighthood, the ceremonies that at the ſame time <hi>Urganda</hi> commanded to be uſed, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment that your father <hi>Amadis de Gaule</hi> gave you to come and ſerve them in this place, and laſtly how in the end we fell aſléep in the great Serpent from whence we were carried (not knowing thereof) to the Palace of <hi>Apolidon,</hi> where when we awaked, we found all our company together (onely you) <hi>Manley,</hi> the King of <hi>Dacia, Ambor,</hi> and <hi>Talanque,</hi> not knowing what was become of you. And while I made this long diſcourſe, the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine</hi> would not ſuffer me to make an end, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting me in my tale, ſaid unto me: Maſter <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when my Couſin <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> returned from thence, I remember that
<pb facs="tcp:57308:23"/>
among other things by him declared, he ſaid ſomething touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the yong gentleman whereof you ſpeak, wherefore I pray you ſhew us what you know of him: wherein ſéeking to fulfil her requeſt, I began to ſhew her the manner of your nativity, how King <hi>Luiſart</hi> found you in the forreſt with the Lions, of the letters he received that day, what letters you had on your body when you were born, whereof ſome were as white as Snow, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyng your own name, the reſt as red as blood, ſhewing the name of your love, as yet unknown, by reaſon the characters cannot be underſtood. Then ſmilingly ſhe asked me how you would know it, and I anſwered her, that love in time would learn, and that for certain ſhe would be of royal blood, and one that ſhould be the beautifulleſt Lady living in her time. Truly (ſaid ſhe) he deſerveth no leſs, wherefore I pray you heartily when you ſée him, perſwade him to come hither and fulfil the promiſe that his father made us, for I have great deſire to ſée him, that he might be as much at our commandment, as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Father <hi>Amadis</hi> hath béen, which I promiſed her to do, although I ſaid I doubted it would not be ſo ſoon as I could wiſh. So my Lord I ſtayed certain days at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſpeaking continually of you, that done, I imbarqued my ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, where by evil fortune we fell into the hands of the Giant <hi>Matroco,</hi> whom as then was upon the Sea. While maſter <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> ſhewed the black Knight of the beauty of the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine,</hi> and what ſhe had inquired of him, love entered ſo far into his heart, that oftentimes he changed colour, but for the time he covered his intent as much as he could: and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into another matter, asked maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> how he found the means to leave King <hi>Luiſart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> As well as I would wiſh (ſaid he) for as ſoon as he had dined, he lay down to ſléep, in the mean time I came hither to you. I pray you (ſaid the Knight) let him know nothing touching me. And wherefore (ſaid maſter <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>) will you hide your ſelf from him, ſéeing there is no Prince living in the world, worthier then he to be honored and ſerved of all good Knights? It is true (ſaid the Knight) but I have done ſo little as yet, that I am aſhamed he ſhould hear no better news of me, ſéeing I am in hope, that in time I ſhall do
<pb facs="tcp:57308:24"/>
great matters, which of themſelves will ſet forth my renown, without the praiſe of other men. Séeing it is your pleaſure (ſaid maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) I will do ſo, although it would rejoyce him much, to hear that ſuch unexpected aid ſhould come unto him onely by your means. That ſhall be at another time (ſaid the Knight) and not now: Wherefore leſt he ſhould miſs you when he awaketh, I pray you return unto the Caſtle, and when you ſée convenient time, come hither again to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit me.

               </argument>
               <p>MAſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> gone from the Hermitage where he left the black Knight, went ſo faſt and made ſuch haſte, that he came again unto the Caſtle, not miſſed of any, yet the King was awake before he came, who leaning in a window, and ſéeing him below in the Court, asked him if he had ſlept: No, and it liketh your Grace (ſaid he) I have béen abroad, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king along the country, which I finde environed with the goodlieſt meddows that ever were ſéen: come up hither (ſaid the King) and we will talk with you, but he was no ſooner entred into the Chamber, when <hi>Carmelle</hi> the Hermites Daughter came to the King, and knéeling down before him, ſaid, May it pleaſe your Grace to entertain me into your ſervice, that am one of your natural ſubjects, and will be during life: wherewith the King took her up and ſaid, Gentlewoman, if you deſire any thing at my hands, aſſure your ſelf it ſhall not be denyed, for I did never during my life but honor and pleaſure ſuch as you are, and although ſuch favors have oftentimes turned to my great trouble, therein do I blame no man but my ſelf, for that God juſtly ſendeth both good and evil, when, where, and to whom it pleaſeth him, wherefore I pray you ſhew me who you are.
<pb facs="tcp:57308:24"/>
Then <hi>Carmelle</hi> made a long diſcourſe, how from her youth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhe had ſerved her miſtriſs <hi>Arcabonne,</hi> and what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion moved her father to become an Hermit, as you heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Truly Gentlewoman (ſaid the King) if you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into great <hi>Britain,</hi> I will take you with me. I will do (ſaid ſhe) what your Grace commandeth: in the mean time I pray you grant me leave to give my father intelligence who you are, for he will be moſt ready and glad to do your Grace ſervice. With a good will (ſaid the King) and tell him I deſire to ſée him, wherewith <hi>Carmelle</hi> thanked his Grace, and becauſe it was late, ſhe went again into her Chamber till the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhe roſe, and iſſuing out of the Caſtle, about break of the day went down a certain path, ſhe ordinarily uſed to go, whereby ſhe came into the Hermitage at ſuch time as the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite and the dumb man were gone to the Barque to fetch ſuch neceſſaries as the black Knight wanted, who in the mean time ſlept in his bed, for after that maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had given him intelligence what the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine</hi> had ſaid, he could not reſt, till the very ſame time when ſhe entered into her Fathers cell, wherein ſhe found him, and not doubting any thing, went into the Chamber, where ſhe heard the black Knight ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ort, wherewith being abaſhed ſhe opened the window, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him aſléep, his Sword hanging at his beds-head, which ſhe took down, and ſoftly drew out of the Scabberd, finding it freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpotted with blood, whereupon ſhe ſuſpected it was he that had ſlain <hi>Frerion, Matroco,</hi> and others in the Caſtle, and as ſhe looked about her ſhe knew his black Armor, wherewith ſhe was in ſuch a fear, that ſhe had almoſt fallen down, and let the Sword fall out of her hands, but taking courage, ſhe went néerer to the bed, to know him better, being fully determined if it were he, to kill him as he lay, and therewith began by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little to uncover his face, but he ſhewed ſo fair, that ſuddenly the fury ſhe had, changed into ſo burning a love, that during her life it was never quenched, in ſuch manner that the more ſhe beheld him, the more did her love increaſe, and as he fell on ſléep when his minde was buſied with the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conceived of <hi>Leonorine,</hi> after <hi>Carmelle</hi> had beheld him long, he
<pb facs="tcp:57308:25"/>
turned towards her, and without waking, caſt forth a great ſigh ſaying in his ſléep, Alas poor wretch, what ſhall become of me? The Gentlewoman knew well he had not ſéen her, wherefore ſhe imboldened her ſelf to kiſs him, and found his face all wet with tears, whereby ſhe feared he had ſome melancholly humor that troubled him, and although ſhe eſtéemed not thereof, féeling her new diſeaſe much more then his grief, taking all to her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, ſhe hoped from that time forwards to find the meanes to obtain his love, yet did ſhe fail thereof, for that love (to ſhew his power) had wounded them both diverſly in one place, and at one time, a thing almoſt incredible, for who would ever think that little god would enter into ſuch a place? Where a poor Hermit lived all alone in moſt ſtrict manner, with a few cold roots, and not his belly full of bread: yet did he overcome them both, in the moſt unfit time (as it may be thought) that could be found, for the black Knight had indured ſo great travel in figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and the Gentlewoman ſéen ſo many of her friends ſlain at one time, that the one had not ſo much néed of comfort, but the other as much cauſe to reſt. If then it be ſo (as it is moſt true) that we are all ſubject to this Tyrant, he that hath paſt the flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his youth, not taſting of his fury, may not think himſelf in any thing more happy, ſéeing it is his manner to conſtrain young men to love, and oftentimes old fools to dote. In that ſort the Gentlewoman did pennance for the evil ſhe conceived againſt the black Knight, and had continued longer there, had it not been for fear to be diſcovered. Wherefore with the ſword in her hand ſhe returned back again towards the Caſtle, and without being once perceived, entred at a poſtern door, whereof ſhe had the key, and ſo went up into her chamber, departing from the hermitage not long before her Father and the dumb man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the barque, and found the Knight ſleeping, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently awaked, and miſſing his Sword, asked them if they had taken it away. No truly (ſaid the Hermit) for we came but now from the Sea ſide Wherewith <hi>Eſplandian</hi> eſteeming it loſt, made account, that as he had conquered it after a ſtrange manner, ſo he had loſt it by a ſtranger means, but the Hermit and the dumb man ſought it about the houſe, and could not finde it.</p>

                  <hi>CArmelle</hi> returned to the Caſtle (as it is ſaid before) went to the King, who at the ſame time was talking with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> touching the wrong he thought the black Knight did him, in departing thence without being known, ſéeking by that means if it were poſſible to draw from him what he knew as touching the Knight: but all in vain, for the King was not ſo ſubtile to undermine him, but maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was as crafty to prevent him, not intending to falſifie the truſt repoſed in him: and although the Gentlewoman had determined to ſhew y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king what ſhe had learned of the Knight, hoping thereby to obtain her purpoſe. Nevertheleſs, ſéeing maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in preſence, ſhe held her peace till he went away, and perceiving the King alone, ſaid unto him, My Lord, if it pleaſeth your Grace to ſhew me ſo much favor, as to aſſiſt me in a thing that importeth me as much my life, in the behalf of the Knight that you ſo much deſire to ſée, before to morrow at night I will ſhew him unto you, if you think good, in ſuch a place, where you may eaſily ſpeak with him: and to the end you ſhall not ſuſpect me of untruth, I will ſhew you a certain token, that when you ſée it, I am aſſured you will eaſily believe me. Gentlewoman (ſaid the King) if you do ſo, I will not fail if it be poſſible, to ſatisfie your requeſt. I beſeech your Grace (ſaid ſhe) when you are both together, it would pleaſe you to be a mean unto him in my behalf to grant me a gift that I ſhall ask him.

Then be you ready (ſaid ſhe) when I ſhall call, and let no man go with you. Content (ſaid the King) wherewith he went out of the Chamber, and paſſing through the Court, he met <hi>Libee</hi> and others, to whom he ſaid, that in the morning he meant to walk along the Rock (becauſe maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had certified him it was ſo goodly a Countrey) and that none but <hi>Carmelle</hi> ſhould bear him company: and falling into other ſpeeches, they paſſed the time till they went to reſt, but the King could not ſléep for the great deſire he had to ſée the Knight, whereby he was hardly fallen aſléep, when <hi>Carmelle</hi> came to awake him, ſaying: My Lord, may it pleaſe your Grace to remember your promiſe? Let us go (ſaid he) and therewith making himſelf ready, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded two horſes to be ſadled, one for himſelf, the other for <hi>Carmelle,</hi> and iſſuing out of the Caſtle, rode toward the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage. And they had not travelled far, but they perceived a man coming towards them in great haſte, and as he came near, the Gentlewoman knew him, asking him what he meant to make ſuch haſte, and whither he rode? I ride to the Caſtle (ſaid be) to fetch <hi>Matroco,</hi> and his brother <hi>Frerion,</hi> with all ſpéed to help their Vncle <hi>Lindoraque,</hi> who coming to ſée them, hath met with two Knights armed all in white, that have ſlain his men, and (as I think) I left him in as great danger as poſſibly may be. When the king heard him, he thought him to be of the black knights company, and ſaid unto the Gentlewoman, I pray you ſtay here with this man, and I will ride to ſee them, and with that he ſet ſpurs to his Horſe, and taking the ſame way the other came, he perceived afar off the two knights fighting with the Giant, that defended himſelf moſt valiantly with his Mace, forcing them oftentimes to recoil, but the two knights as bold as nimble, handled him in ſuch ſort, that he knew not how to defend himſelf, and if he had not ſlain one of their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, it had gone worſe with him. Neverthleſs the knight on horſe-back ſeeking to revenge his companion, was nothing aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, but when the other roſe up, ſet more fierce upon the Giant then before, in ſuch maner, that they cloſed, and ſtriving toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſought by all means to unhorſe each other. Mean time the knight on foot went unto the Giant, and taking him by the left
<pb facs="tcp:57308:26"/>
leg, pulled him by ſuch force, that both he and the other knight fell off their horſes, and holding each other faſt, the Giant fell under with his face upwards, wherewith the knight that threw him down, thruſt him into the face, that he was conſtrained to let go his hold, nevertheleſs riſing up again with great force, and laying hold upon the knight that had ſo wounded him, he threw him on the ground, mean time the other gave the Giant ſuch a blow upon the head, that he began to réel, and therewith ſtretching out his legs, yielded up the ghoſt. With that the king rode ſomewhat nearer, and perceived the two knights to bear black Croſſes, that ſhewed them to be Chriſtians, wherefore ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding boldly unto them, he went ſo near that they knew him, whereupon they went to do him honor, much abaſhed to ſée him. But the King perceiving the honor they did him, was no leſs abaſhed, and ſaid unto them: My good friends, I know you not, I pray you put off your Helmets that I may ſee your faces, which they did, whereby he knew the one to be <hi>Talanque</hi> ſon of <hi>Galaor,</hi> the other <hi>Ambor de Gadel,</hi> ſon of <hi>Angriote de Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaulx,</hi> whom he friendly embraced, and ſaid unto them, In faith my good friends, it is not without cauſe, if it liketh you well, to ſée me here, for all my life have I deſired the companies of your fathers, the like do I of their children, wherefore for the love of God I pray you ſhew me what ſtrange adventure hath brought you into this Countrey. And it pleaſeth your Grace (ſaid <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanque</hi>) we ſéek after a Knight armed all in black, of whom as yet we can hear no newes. Do you know his name (ſaid the king?)

<pb facs="tcp:57308:27"/>
My Lord, where hath your Grace gotten company ſo ſoon? Gentlewoman (ſaid he) you ſhall know it all in good time, but what have you done (ſaid he) with the man that I left with you? Let us know what news he hath told you. Truly (ſaid ſhe) I had no ſooner aſſured him of the death of <hi>Matroco</hi> and the reſt of the Caſtle, but he fled over this hill, as if all the devils in hell had been behind him: yet he told me that the Giant his maſter had heard ſome rumor thereof, and for the ſame cauſe was coming to the Caſtle to know the truth, accompanied onely with two Knights, that he cauſed to ride before him, but to their hard fortunes, for he found them both ſlain, not knowing who had done it, but onely that not long after he met with two ſtrange Knights, that aſſayled him, and left them fighting (as he ſaid) together. By God (ſaid the King) if the firſt two Knights ſped hardly, their maſter that followed after them had little better entertainment, for they are all ſlain upon the way, and here are the Knights that did it, whom I pray you let us take with us, for they are friends and companions unto that Knight you have promiſed to ſhew me. Let us go then (ſaid ſhe) ſeeing it is your Graces pleaſure: and therewith they rode unto the Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, at the entery whereof, they found the Hermit ſet upon a ſtone, who being abaſhed to ſee his daughter in ſuch company, asked whither ſhe went. Father (ſaid ſhe) here is King <hi>Lui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart</hi> your Prince and mine, whom I have brought to ſee you. And althought the Hermit had not ſeen him in long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet he preſently knew him, wherewith he ſtepped to kiſs his feet, which the King would not ſuffer him to do, but imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him, and lighting off his horſe, followed the Gentlewoman, till he met the dumb man, that hearing the noiſe and trampling of horſes, came to ſee who they were, and perceiving the king, he bowed his head before him. Nevertheleſs the king went foward, not ſtaying to ſpeak unto him, entring preſently after <hi>Carmelle</hi> into the Chamber, where he found the knight ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the beds-ſide. Wherewith <hi>Eſplandian</hi> preſently knew him, but the king taking him up, weeping for joy imbraced him. With that <hi>Talanque</hi> and <hi>Ambor</hi> entred in, and perceiving their companion (that they ſo long had ſought) were marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb facs="tcp:57308:27"/>
glad, and coming to imbrace him, the King ſaid unto <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandian:</hi> My ſon, although you have ſought by all means to hide your ſelf from us, yet God hath ſo wrought, that at one inſtant we have all three found you out: wherefore I pray you let us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part hence, and go with us unto the Caſtle, where you ſhall be better at your eaſe than in this ſimple Hermitage. My Lord, (ſaid he) I am at your commandment, with that he went to imbrace <hi>Talanque</hi> and <hi>Ambor,</hi> asking them (and they him) what had happened unto them ſince <hi>Urganda</hi> cauſed them to be dubbed Knights. By Gods help (ſaid the King) you ſhall ſtay to hear the ſequel until we be in the Caſtle, for then you ſhall have better leiſure to declare the ſame. With that he called <hi>Carmelle,</hi> willing her to return with all dilligence to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and command <hi>Libee</hi> to bring one of <hi>Matroco's</hi> Horſes for <hi>Eſplandian.</hi> My Lord (ſaid <hi>Ambor</hi>) it will be late before he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth hither, he ſhall rather have my Horſe, and I will go on foot: but you ſhall not (ſaid the King) get you upon <hi>Carmelles</hi> Horſe, and let her ſit up behinde you. In which manner they rode unto the Caſtle, after whom the Hermit and the dumb man followed as faſt as they could. But they ſcarce alighted off their horſes, <hi>Ambor</hi> and <hi>Talanque</hi> being unarmed, but <hi>Carmelle</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with the extream paſſions of love ſhe bare unto the black Knight, had almoſt ſlain her ſelf with the ſword that the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe had ſtoln from him, the occaſion whereof procéeded from a conceit that he would diſdain her as unworthy of him, he being the ſon of <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> as ſhe underſtood: yet in the end ſhe remembred the promiſe the king had made, wherefore ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to deſire ſo much of him, to be a means unto <hi>Eſplandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> that he would grant ſhe might never be abſent from him, but would ſerve him during her life with all fidelity, and to the ſame end, putting her determination in effect, as they ſat all together, ſhe kneeled before the king, and ſaid, My Lord, now your Grace ſéeth I have kept my promiſe. That is true (ſaid he) and while I live I ſhall not be unmindful of it. My Lord (ſaid ſhe) then I truſt your Grace hath not forgotten the gift you promiſed me: and to perform your word, I pray you be a means to the black Knight that he will grant me my requeſt. Gentlewoman (ſaid the
<pb facs="tcp:57308:28"/>
King) be you aſſured I will do it with all my heart. Your Grace (ſaid ſhe) as yeſterday gave me leave to viſite my father in the Hermitage, who as it fortuned when I came thither was gone forth, whereat I was abaſhed, becauſe he never uſed to be far from thence: And finding the door open, I went into a chamber (that I cauſed to be furniſhed) wherein ſometimes I uſe to lie, when time or foul weather would not permit me to return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the caſtle, where I found this Knight (pointing to <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) which you alſo much deſired to ſée, faſt ſléeping, his Sword han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging at his beds-head, wherewith not long ſithence he hath ſlain thoſe, that from my infancy had brought me up, and being moved by reaſon of my no little loſs, with a deſire to revenge both my ſelf and my friends, I thought to kill him, and was ſo néer the point to execute my will, that as I held the Sword drawn in my hand, and began to lift up mine arm to give the blow, he ſéemed ſo fair within mine eye, that ſuddenly I was ſurpriſed with love, and that ſo fervently, that were it not for the promiſe you have made me, I had not béen alive at this preſent time. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs having ſithence underſtood, that he by whom I am in this extremity, in eſtate and degrée, not to be my equal, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I perceive my ſelf unworthy either to be wife or companion unto him, I have ſomewhat moderated my firſt deliberation in ſuch manner, that I will hold my ſelf more then ſatisfied, if it pleaſe him I may only continue with him, to ſerve at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment during my life, which in reaſon he cannot well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny me, for let him do what he will, ſo long as life is in my body, I will never forſake him, if I be not conſtrained thereunto. Wherefore my Lord, for the honor of God, I beſéech your Grace to finde the means my poor requeſt may once be granted, and you Gentlemen (ſaid ſhe to <hi>Ambor</hi> and <hi>Talanque</hi>) I pray you put to your helps, that by your favors the life of me poor lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, not beloved, may be prolonged. The King hearing the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman (that while ſhe ſpake ſometime bluſhed, and other whiles waxed pale) make this diſcourſe, could hardly abſtain to laugh, thinking how inconſiderately ſhe had fallen into ſo great extremity, whereby he feared if he ſhould make an anſwer other then pleaſed her, ſhe would kill her ſelf, but with courteous

ſpéech he ſaid unto her: Gentlewoman, your requeſt is ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that I am of opinion he will not deny it: and for my part, I will intreat him as much as poſsible I can. My Lord (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) I will do what your Grace commandeth Grant her then I pray you (ſaid the King) what ſhe craveth at your hands, that from henceforth ſhe may be called your faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, her honor always ſaved, as in the Knighthood you are bound. I will do it, anſwered <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> and thereof I aſſure you (ſaith he) ſpeaking to <hi>Carmelle,</hi> who knéeling on the ground kiſſed his féet, and thanked the King and him moſt heartily, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting her ſelf moſt happy, in obtaining ſo great favor.</p>

                  <p>How <hi>Talanque</hi> and <hi>Ambor</hi> ſhewed the King what adventure they had found ſeeking for <hi>Eſplandian</hi> their companion, after they had received the order of Knighthood.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>YOu heard before in what ſort King <hi>Luiſart</hi> was delivered cut of priſon by his nephew <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> but as yet he knew not the manner how he received the order of Knighthood. Wherefore as they roſe from dinner, the King deſired him to tel him how he was made Knight, as alſo what happened unto him ſince that time, to the end (ſaid he) that <hi>Talanque</hi> and <hi>Ambor</hi> may do the like. Then <hi>Eſplandian</hi> told how <hi>Urganda</hi> came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ferm Iſland in the great Serpent, what ſpéech ſhe had with <hi>Amadis De Gaule,</hi> and others that were with him, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhe uſed to dub him Knight, together with <hi>Talanque, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, Manely,</hi> and the King of <hi>Denmark:</hi> The ſléep wherein they fell, and that when he awaked, he found himſelf at the foot of the Rock of the Enchantreſs, in company of <hi>Sergil</hi> his Squire and two dumb men, alſo how he conquered the Sword, with his arrival at the mountain, where he found the Hermit, that diſſwaded him from fighting with the Giants. By my head (ſaid the King) I never heard ſtranger things. And now <hi>Ambor</hi> (ſaid he) what became of you? My Lord (ſaid <hi>Ambor</hi>) my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion and I were likewiſe aſléep, and when we awaked we found our ſelves in a little Barque with our two horſes, in a
<pb facs="tcp:57308:29"/>
Haven of the Sea called <hi>Armata,</hi> in the Countrey of <hi>Norway,</hi> (as then unknown to us) where we landed before a Town, not onely to know in what countrey we were, but alſo to ſéek for vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals. And as we went towards it, the watch of the town (by reaſon of certain diſſenſion not long before moved betwéen them and their neighbors) ſent to know what we would have. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we made them anſwer, we were Knights adventurous that came from <hi>the Ferm Iſle,</hi> caſt upon that ſhore by tempeſt of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In good truth ſaid he that ſpake unto us, our king hath ſo great cauſe to uſe your helps, that if you go unto him, I am well aſſured he will bid you welcome. We asked him the Kings name, and what Countrey we were in. My Lords (ſaid he) the Countrey is called <hi>Norway,</hi> whereof <hi>Adroni</hi> father in law to <hi>Agraies,</hi> ſon to the King of <hi>Scots</hi> one, of the beſt Knights in the world, is our King, I know not whether you know him. And what cauſe (ſaid we) hath your King to uſe our help? I will tell you (ſaid he) he is ſo old, that one of his nephews, his Siſters ſon, (procured thereto by evil counſel) is riſen in Arms againſt him, ſéeking to have the Government of the Countrey, in reſpect (as he ſaith) his Vncle is no more able to rule the ſame. And under that pretence hath already uſurped a great part thereof, and now lieth in Camp before one of the beſt Cities in this Land, which the King by no means can relieve, by reaſon that moſt of his truſtieſt friends have forſaken him, and hold with the young preſumptuous fool, that winneth them by fair promiſes, a thing that oftentimes happeneth unto ſuch as fortune favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, and when men are fallen, they are not onely abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſtrangers, but by their own kindred and friends, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly may be tearmed friends for the preſent time. In good faith (ſaid we) if the Town will give us victuals, and one to guide us, we will gladly go and preſent our ſervice unto him, not only for the love of <hi>Agraies,</hi> to whom we are companions, but for the right he hath, as you have told us. That ſhall be done (ſaid he) and therewith deſired us to ſtay till he came again from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where he ſtayed not long, but he brought what we deſired, and a guide that conducted us ſo well, that the next day about dinner time we arrived where the king lay. Who being adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb facs="tcp:57308:29"/>
of our coming, and that we were of <hi>Agraies</hi> companions entertained us moſt courteouſly, commanding one of his Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen to unarm us in one of his beſt chambers, whither he came, and after he had bidden us welcome, began in the ſame manner to ſhew us all what the watch had before declared unto us, and what an unnatural part his Nephew ſhewed unto him, procured thereunto by two Knights, in whom onely he putteth his whole truſt, becauſe (ſaid he) they are well aſſured, that not any of my Knights dareth enter into combate with them, they are eſtéemed ſo valiant and hardy. But who hath moved them and your couſin (ſaid we) to undertake ſo foul an action? Becauſe (ſaid the King) I have no iſſue male, and my couſin alledgeth I am over old to govern the country, ſaying, it is fitter for him then for me to do it: but if I can I will hold him from it, and kéep it for my daughter <hi>Ol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But when he heard me ſpeak in that manner, he pauſed a while, ſéeming very penſive, till in the end he anſwered me and ſaid, Sir Knights, I am not yet ſo well acquainted with you, that I ſhould venture to hazard ſo great a Kingdom as this is upon your valor: Nevertheleſs, if you will aſſure me for a truth that you are Knights of the Ferm Iſland, I am content to ſtand to it whatſoever may chance. For there can none but valiant Knights come from thence, being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured (as I ſuppoſe) that otherwiſe the Lord of the place would not give them intertainment. Then we ſwore unto him, that what we had ſaid was true. Whereupon he preſently diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched a trumpet with meſſage to his enemy, to offer him the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, who hearing the news ſéemed very glad, making account that his two Knights (ſo much eſtéemed) would eaſily overcome any two of the beſt Knights the King had. So that returning the
<pb facs="tcp:57308:30"/>
meſſenger again, he ſent one of his trumpets with him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the combate, with the day, time and place where it ſhould be done, as alſo what pledges ſhould on both ſides be given for performance thereof, ſo that on the day appointed, after each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had ſolemnly taken their oaths, we entred into that liſts, where we had a cruel and dangerous Combate one againſt the other, but in the end, right lying in our ſides, we wan the victory. And as we would have ſtricken off their heads, the kings nephew deſired us moſt earneſtly to grant them their lives which we agréed unto, upon condition, that from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he ſhould ſuffer his uncle to raign in peace, not moleſting him any more, which he promiſed to perform. In this Combate we were ſo wounded, that of force we continued in <hi>Norway</hi> lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then we meant to do, where during our abode, certain Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants arrived in the City, that had ſéen (as they told us) upon the Sea, néer unto the Rock of the enchantreſs, a Serpent grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then any veſſel, which ſo much aſtoniſhed them, that they knew not what to do, whereby we heard news of <hi>Eſplandian.</hi> With that (although we were not altogether healed of our wounds) yet we beſought the King to cauſe us to be conducted thither, which he willingly granted, and we took Sea, with ſo good a wind, that within ſix days after we approached the Rock where the Serpent ſtayed, that at the firſt made us ſomewhat abaſhed, although we had ſeen it oftentimes before. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, we found it flaſhing ſuch flames of fire out of the mouth and noſtrils thereof, that we feared the fire would fall into our Ship, whereby not without much pain and trouble, we procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red our Maſter and Mariners to approach it, and perceiving no creature aboard to ſpeak unto, we began to hollow unto them with ſo loud a voice, that at the laſt <hi>Sergil</hi> appeared upon the hatches, and wéeping, told us what had happened unto his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter on the Rock of the Enchantreſs, and how after that one of the dumb men had cauſed him to enter into a little Barque, and therewith put to Sea, ſo that he knew not if he were dead or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, for he had heard no news of him, and there he ſtayed with another dumb man in the greateſt care that might be. With that we willed him to call the dumb man unto us, and when he
<pb facs="tcp:57308:30"/>
came, by ſigns we made unto him, we ſhewed him what pleaſure he might do us if he would bring us to the place where his fellow had carryed <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> which as it ſéemed he was content to do, for preſently thereupon he entred into our veſſels and ſailed ſo well, that the tenth day after he ſet us on land, hard by the place where we ſlew the Giant and the two Knights, and ſo your Grace hath heard what fortunes we have paſſed ſince we received the order of Knighthood. Truly (ſaid the King) if thoſe of <hi>Manely</hi> and the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> be as ſtrange, it may well be ſaid, there never happened the like beginning unto ſix young Knights.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THe Gentlewoman that brought the meſſage with the two dumb men, imbarqued and put to Sea, far from the Rock: King <hi>Luiſart</hi> and the reſt went unto the Caſtle, where he ſtayed not long, for according to the advice <hi>Urganda</hi> had given him, he deſired <hi>Ambor</hi> and <hi>Talanque,</hi> with <hi>Libee</hi> and the reſt of the company to keep the Caſtle, promiſing with all ſpeed to ſend them proviſion of all things neceſſary, whereof they wanted. But when <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ſaw there was no remedy, but of force he muſt obey the King (much diſpleaſed to depart ſo far from the

borders of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he hoped to finde her where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had brought him the firſt news) he took his faithful ſervant <hi>Carmelle</hi> aſide, and ſaid unto her: My good friend, I was in mind never to falſifie the promiſe I have made you, nor the gift you required at my hands, nevertheleſs, truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more in you then any other, I pray you take it not in evil part, if (to ſave my life) I ſend you to a place, whither I thought to have gone my ſelf in perſon, but it pleaſeth the King (as you well know) that I ſhall bear him company. My Lord (ſaid ſhe) I moſt humbly thank you for the honor it pleaſeth you to ſhew me, ſwearing unto you by the living God, that I take no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure but in fulfilling your deſire, wherefore I pray you fear not to command me what you think good, for whatſoever may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen thereby, I will be obedient unto you during my life. My good friend (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) imbracing her, I will one day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence your good will, and ſéeing you are minded to do me ſo much favor, you muſt then take your journey to <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> on meſſage to the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine,</hi> the Emperors daughter, to whom (having preſented my moſt humble and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty commendations) you ſhall on my behalf ſay, How that at ſuch time as I received the order of Knighthood, I was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by my lord <hi>Amadis</hi> my father to repair to her fathers court, there to diſcharge him of the promiſe he made unto her (which was either to return again to do her ſervice, or to ſend one of his linage thither in his place) Nevertheleſs, conſidering with my ſelf his great valor and proweſs, and the great beauty that is reported to be in her, which my ſmall deſert in reward of him that gave me the commandment, I am afraid to undertake the ſame. Notwithſtanding, it hath pleaſed her (by maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) to put me in minde thereof, although while breath is in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy I will never fail to be her Knight. And to the end ſhe may give credit to your meſſage, you ſhall preſent this ring unto her, which ſhe knoweth well, as being the ſame ſhe gave unto my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to put him in remembrance of his promiſe. My Lord (ſaid ſhe) I will fulfil your commandment, but if you go ſo far from hence, where ſhall I finde you, when I come back again?

               <argument>
                  <p>How King <hi>Luiſart</hi> departed from the Ferm Iſle, accompanied of divers Knights, Ladies, and Gentlewomen, and being neer <hi>London,</hi> in a foreſt they met four Knights, that ſent to ask four courſes with their launces againſt <hi>Eſplandian.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>THrée days King <hi>Luiſart</hi> continued in the Ferm Iſle, and the fourth day he determinded to go ſée the Quéen, and to the ſame end, with all that company of Knights, Ladies, &amp; Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women,
<pb facs="tcp:57308:33"/>
he ſet forwards towards <hi>London,</hi> and travelled ſo faſt, that they were within a days journey of the City. And as they entred into a forreſt, where they uſed commonly to chaſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hart, they ſaw in the high way four knights, well mounted &amp; armed at all points, each his Squire by his ſide, bearing their ſhield and launces, for they had their helmets on their heads. And with that they perceived a Gentlewoman coming towards them, riding on a palfrey, and being néer them, ſpeaking to <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> ſhe ſaid, Sir knight with the white arms, thoſe four knights you ſée in the high way before you, ſend you word by me, that they would gladly know the cauſe why you bear the device of crowns, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if you ſatisfie their deſire, in ſuch ſort that their honors be not ſtained, they will from henceforth refrain to inquire the ſame any more: otherwiſe, they give you by me to underſtand, it were beſt for you to leave them, or elſe that you defend them well, as being the moſt honorable deviſe that is in all the world. When <hi>Eſplandian</hi> heard her ſpeak in that manner, in courteous ſort he anſwered her, and ſaid, Gentlewoman, to ſatisfie their requeſt I pray you tell them that the deviſe and the arms I bear was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me by <hi>Urganda,</hi> but for what cauſe I know not, nevertheleſs I bear them for the love of her, as alſo that they like me wel: and if this content them not, tell them, me thinketh the occaſion of combate betwéen me and them is ſo ſmall, that for this time I would deſire them to forbear the ſame. In good faith (ſaid ſhe) ſmiling, you ſpeak with reaſon, for they are Knights that ſéem to have much néed of your councel, but notwithſtanding good ſir, I pray you be not unprovided, for your excuſes will not be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Gentlewoman (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) if they aſſayl me, it ſhall be againſt my will. Truly (ſaid ſhe) as far as I perceive, the great beauty that is in you, together with the rich arms and goodly horſe you ride upon, are worſe beſtowed then ever was any, when you are not aſhamed to make an anſwer ſo little to your credit. Nevertheleſs, either you muſt forſake the way to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and this good company, or defend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherewith <hi>Amadis</hi> and the reſt of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were excéeding glad, doubting leſt the King had ſpoken in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of him, when he thewed what he had done, but they had not ridden long, but one of the four Knights came riding ſoftly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and about a careers length from them, calling to <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and ſaid, You ſir Knight that would not ſatisfie our deſires, defend your ſelf from me. Wherewith he ſet ſpurs to his horſe and <hi>Eſplandian</hi> likewiſe, who at the firſt encounter caſt him ſo ſtrongly out of his ſaddle, that in long time after he could not riſe again, therewith his launce brake: with that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Knight came forwards, willing <hi>Eſplandian</hi> to take another launce, for he meant to revenge his companion. Which <hi>Amadis</hi> hearing, ſent him his launce, that he willingly received, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a rage to ſée himſelf aſſayled without cauſe, he ran againſt the knight &amp; brake him ſo ſurely on the breaſt, that he overthrew him both horſe and man. Well (ſaid the king) to the ſtanders by, judge you if it be poſsible to do better? My Lord (ſaid <hi>Agraies</hi>) I never ſaw two fairer ſtrokes given with a launce, the reſt I will leave to conſider of till I know thoſe that ran againſt him. Let us ſée the end (ſaid the king) and calling a Squire, he ſent his launce unto <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> for as then the third kinght prepared himſelf to run, and ſpurring their horſes, ſet forwards ſo fiercely, that breaking their launces, they met ſo ſtrongly, body and ſhields, and heads together, that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> had much ado to ſit upon his horſe, and the other had ſuch a fall, that he lay ſtill upon the ground. Whereat the fourth knight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abaſhed, ſaid unto himſelf, Truly, both the king and <hi>Urgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> have good reaſon (as they do) to aſſure the valor and proweſs of this knight, ſéeing it it much more then they warrant it to be: Nevertheleſs, I muſt of force try him, otherwiſe I ſhould do both my ſelf and him wrong. And with that he called <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and ſaid, Knight, although I well know the ſmall courteſie that I and my companions have ſhewed unto you, yet I muſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
<pb facs="tcp:57308:34"/>
to do the ſame that they have done before me, wherefore I pray you ſend to ſome of your company for another launce, that we may ſée who ſhall bear the honor of this enterpriſe. I will do it (ſaid he) ſéeing you conſtrain me thereunto, upon condition that if I can, I will ſerve you in the like ſort I have done your companions. With that <hi>Granſador</hi> that heard them ſpeak, gave him his launce, which he preſently charging, they met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſuch force, that their launces brake cloſe unto their hands, neither of them removing out his ſaddle, wherefore the Knight of the forreſt turned to <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and ſaid, Sir Knight, let us yet try one blow more, and I will quire you for this time. You might content your ſelf (ſaid he) with that is done, but ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you are ſo void of reaſon, I am content to try it with you, till one of us be beaten off his horſe. Then he ſent <hi>Sergil</hi> to fetch another launce, and he brought him one ſomewhat bigger and ſhorter then thoſe he had before, wherewith he ſtroke the Knight of the forreſt ſo valiantly, that he overthrew him, himſelf being conſtrained to imbrace his horſe about the neck, or elſe he had fallen as the other did that lay on the ground, yet he roſe before <hi>Eſplandian</hi> had run out his courſe and as he returned back, he ſtayed him by the armor and ſaid unto him, Before God ſir Knight, you have ſufficiently ſhewed that in valor and proweſs you are ſecond to none but to your ſelf: but he anſwered not a word, but holding down his head (aſhamed of that had happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto him) paſſed forth. With that the King came thither to know what Knights they were that had béen overthrown, amongt the which he knew <hi>Galaor,</hi> for he had put off his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met to do him honor when he ſaw him come, whereat the King was ſo well pleaſed, that he alighted off his horſe and ran to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him, the like did <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing unto him, with a ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling countenance, How now brother <hi>Galaor,</hi> how long have you uſed to be a kéeper of the high ways? You ſée (ſaid he) that I and my companions have ſought to try whether this Knight be of ſuch force as we have found him, and what hath happened you may well judge. When <hi>Eſplandian</hi> underſtood his uncle <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lador</hi> (fearing to have offended) he lighted off his horſe, and knéeling down before him, asked pardon for his fault. Nephew
<pb facs="tcp:57308:35"/>
(ſaid he) it is I that have done the wrong, and therefore I told the king that you are a better knight then I, and marvel not if I ſought to prove it, becauſe I thought to do it with mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, but I found the contrary, which from henceforth ſhall make me think the things foreſhewed of you will be accompliſhed ſo well, that the glory of your father, and the reputation by many knights in times paſt obtained, ſhall from henceforth be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, you having ſo eaſily overthrown thrée of the beſt knights in <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> and my ſelf the fourth. What are they (ſaid the king?) My Lord (ſaid <hi>Galaor</hi>) the firſt that ran was <hi>Sendale</hi> of <hi>Gonaſte,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Galuanes,</hi> the third <hi>Angriote d'eſtrauaulx,</hi> and my ſelf hath done worſe then they. Whereat the king and all the company began to laugh, and embracing them, cauſed them to mount on horſeback, riding towards <hi>London,</hi> where in the way the king prayed them to tell him how this enterprize was deviſed. My Lord (ſaid <hi>Galaor</hi>) having underſtood by the Daniſh Gentlewoman (that my Lady <hi>Oriane</hi> not long ſince ſent unto the Queen, to bring her news of your return, and what had happened unto you during your impriſonment) the valiant acts by you declared of my Nephew <hi>Eſplandain,</hi> we conceived ſuch a jealouſie againſt him, eſtéeming the honor you did him thereby, to procéed rather of fatherly love then otherwiſe, that we determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſecretly to depart ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of my faith (ſaid the king) the device was good, and hath fallen out well. In this maner deviſing of ſundry things, he came to <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> where the Quéen met him, praiſing God for his unexpected return, and conſidering his trouble paſt, with the grief ſhe had for his long abſence, ſéeing him there ſafe and in good health, ſhe thought her ſelf well recompenced with his preſence. The next day in the morning they ſet forwards towards <hi>London,</hi> where the people wept for joy to ſée him, for there was never Prince better loved of his ſubjects than he. Being there, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> began to be weary of the place, longing to hear news of <hi>Carmelle,</hi> that he had ſent to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as you have heard before. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every day he deviſed means to get licence to depart from
<pb facs="tcp:57308:35"/>
thence, pretending a cauſe of returning to the Caſtle called <hi>the defended mountain,</hi> ſhewing the king what promiſe he had made to his Companions, which if he did not perform, they ſhould have cauſe to complain of him, but the king would not in any ſort grant to his requeſt, yet in the end, overcome with much impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, he was content, wherewith he took his leave of all the Court; and upon a munday in the morning taking horſe, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied onely of maſter <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi>Sergil</hi> his Squire, he took his way towards <hi>the Ferme Iſle,</hi> hoping to finde the great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent there, wherein they might imbarque themſelves.</p>

                  <hi>ESplandian</hi> departed from the King, and having taken his leave of all the Court, as you heard before, took the crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt way he could, through woods and forreſts towards <hi>the Ferm Iſle,</hi> thinking not to be perceived of any, that might hinder his enterprize. And having ridden thrée miles, he entred into a Forreſt, which having almoſt paſſed, he came unto a great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver whereupon the king had built a houſe, called <hi>Belleroſe,</hi> where oftentimes being on hunting, he uſed to reſort. And as he thought to paſs the Bridge, he perceived on the other ſide a Knight armed at all points ready to fight, that cried unto him with a loud voice, and ſaid: Sir knight, you muſt ask me leave if you will come over, for according to my promiſe, I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon me to kéep this bridge for the ſpace of one whole year, wherefore if you think good, you may take ſome other way. With that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> was much grieved, perceiving that either of force he muſt fight, or ſéek another paſſage, wherefore he would willingly have excuſed him, and ſaid: Sir knight, I pray you then ſhew me which way I were beſt to go, for by me you ſhall have no cauſe at this time to trouble your ſelf. You muſt return again to <hi>London</hi> (ſaid he) for other paſſage there is none, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you will looſe your horſe, and go on foot. Rather then I would do ſo (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) I will prove if. I can win yours,

and therewith lacing his helmet, took his launce and road unto the Knight, who no ſooner perceived him coming, but ſetting ſpurs to his horſe, ran towards him, whereby they met ſo fiercely together, that both the knights fell off their horſes, in ſuch manner, that maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>Sergil,</hi> thought verily they had ſlain each other, but they ſtayed not long before they roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and laying hand on their ſwords, there began between them the crueleſt and moſt dangerous battel that ever was ſeen: wherea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Mean time the two Knights continued in moſt cruel fight, ſtill increaſing their mights, cleaving ſhields and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, in ſuch ſort, that all the field was covered with pieces of the harneſs, and dyed with blood that iſſued from their bodies, till at the laſt knight of the bridge ſtept back and ſaid unto <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandian,</hi> Sir Knight, take another way, and I am content to quite you of combate, for you are the valianteſt knight that ever I dealt withal, and it ſhould diſpleaſe me much, if by your wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs you would be cauſe of your own death. In good faith (ſaid he) I had done it at the firſt, had it not been the fear I had, that you would eſteem me a coward, but knowing very well that the honor of this combate cannot be had, but onely by the death of one of us, or both together, I will try my fortune, till I be no longer able to weld a ſword. Is that true (ſaid the knight?) Then let us ſee to whom fortune will be favorable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therewith co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering themſelves with that little of their ſhields that reſted in their hands, they began the combate crueller then before, and though all the day they had not given a ſtroke, ſo that after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cruel blows with their ſwords, they cloſed together, &amp; wraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling long time, they ſought to caſt each other to the ground. But ſeeing the little advantage gotten thereby, they began again to lay on with their ſwords with ſuch fury, that <hi>Sergil</hi> looked for no other but when they ſhould fall dead upon the ground, not being able to judge who would have the victory.

But not I you (ſaid he) unleſs you tell me your name. I will not deny you that (ſaid <hi>Amadis</hi>) wherefore cauſe maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to come hither, for I think we have both néed of his help. Then <hi>Eſplandian</hi> called him unto them, mean time <hi>Aamdis</hi> put off his helmet, ſo faint and weary, that he was conſtrained to lean unto a trée. But when <hi>Eſplandian</hi> knew him, and perceiving the fault he had committed, he caſt forth a great cry, and ſaid: Alas wicked wretch that I am, and therewith he fell upon the ground, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>Amadis</hi> thinking him to be in a ſwoon, ran to lift him up, but it was not ſo, onely that it grieved him he had dealt in ſuch manner with his father, who ſaid unto him, Son, although I am as ſore wounded as poſſible may be, without death, yet have I not received ſo much hurt, as conceived plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, perceiving the valor I find to be in you, wherefore be not diſcomforted. Notwithſtanding he could not content himſelf, but curſed his own life, being (as he ſaid) the moſt unhappy man that ever was born of woman. And continuing in that grief, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blood in divers places ran out of his body, whereby he waxed faint, which maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> perceiving, and knowing aſſuredly, if remedy were not ſpéedily had, they were both in danger of their lives, he ſaid unto them: I pray you for this time leave off your ſorrow, and let us preſently go to <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> not far from hence, for you both have greater néed of reſt, then of longer ſtaying in

Such was the combate between the two Knights as you have heard, yet ſome write, that <hi>Amadis</hi> was ſo wounded by <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> that in the end with a thruſt of a launce into the right ſhoulder, and other blows with his Sword, he was ſlain in the field, which <hi>Oriane</hi> hearing, threw her ſelf out of a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and brake her neck. But it is not true, for they raigned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that both in <hi>France</hi> and great <hi>Britain,</hi> and had another Son named <hi>Perion,</hi> and a Daughter no leſs beautiful then her Mother, that marryed <hi>Arquiſil</hi> Son to the Emperor of <hi>Rome.</hi> But I cannot conceive from whence thoſe lyars could invent ſuch a thing, if they underſtand not by (death) the ſhadows that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> cauſed his fathers valiant acts to be covered withal, by the light &amp; pleaſant ſhining of his own, whereby his fathers were ſo much had in oblivion, that there was no more brute of them, then if they had never been done. But to return again unto our matter, you muſt note that news went preſently unto the court, what had chanced to the two knights. Wherewith the King &amp; <hi>Oriane</hi> much diſpleaſed, departed from <hi>London,</hi> &amp; came to <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> when maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> began the ſecond time to dreſs their wounds Whereby he perceived them out of danger, and cured them ſo well, that within ſeven days after they could walk about the Chamber, which put <hi>Oriane</hi> in better comfort then before, and it fell out well for her, for if her melancholy had longer indured ſhe had for certain died at that time. And becauſe the King had not as yet underſtood the reaſon that moved them to fight, one day when he found <hi>Amadis</hi> in good diſpoſition, he prayed him to tell him. In faith my lord (ſaid he) I was deſirous to have the difference of our two forces known, being aſſured, that whatſoever chanced thereby, it could not be but to mine honor: for if my ſon be a better Knight then my ſelf, his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor for the preſent time, will increaſe my glory paſt. Before God (ſaid the King) your enterpriſe was but raſhly undertaken, I pray you another time let us leave ſuch youthful parts for thoſe that are but entring into arms.

               </argument>
               <p>YOu heard before of the adventures of <hi>Eſplandian, Ambor</hi> and <hi>Talanque,</hi> after they had received the order of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, now you ſhall hear what became of <hi>Garinter</hi> King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> and <hi>Manely,</hi> who ſléeping as others did by the ſound of ſix trumpets that played on the ſhore, the next night they found themſelves with their Squires in a little Barque, ſo far out of all knowledge, that although they had landed they knew not where they were, and it was ſo dark, that they could not ſée each other, till at the laſt they perceived a fire not far from thence, that moved them to go thither, to ſée if they could find any that would ſhew them in what country they were, therefore leaving their Squires to kéep their Barque, they took their ſhields, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up a little hill, they perceived a fire burning circle wiſe, in the middle whereof they ſaw a woman holding a yong childe in her arms, &amp; about the fire ſtood ten knights all armed, that ſought to take her, but by no means they could come néer her, ſhe was ſo well defended by the fire. And as they went néerer unto it, they heard one among the reſt that ſaid unto her, Ha, thou falſe and accurſed wretch, thy devilliſh ſpirits and familiars can now no longer help thée, but at this time thou ſhalt ſurely die. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Manely</hi> and <hi>Garinter</hi> had their helmets on their heads, yet the woman they ſo threatned, knew them well, calling them and ſaid: Help me my ſons, and fail me not I pray you at this time: With that <hi>Manely</hi> and the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> knew her by her voice, wherefore laying hands on their ſwords, they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched towards the ten Knights, whereof one of them ſtepped
<pb facs="tcp:57308:38"/>
before the reſt, asking them if they knew that wicked woman that had done him the greateſt miſchief that ever was. By God ſir Knight (ſaid <hi>Manely</hi>) you lie in your throat, ſhe is not wicked, but faithfuller for her part, then you for yours. Wherewith they ran each upon other, and there began the combate of ten Knights againſt two, and although the match was not equal, <hi>Manely</hi> and the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſetting their backs together, laid valiantly upon them, yet in the end they could not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, but <hi>Urganda</hi> playing her part, put out the fire, and taking her two knights aſide, left the reſt in the dark, ſtriking each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as if <hi>Manely</hi> and the king of <hi>Denmark</hi> had béen with them, Mean time <hi>Urganda</hi> and her company got into the thicket of the wood, and having travelled long, at the laſt the moon began to ſhine, when they were weary, whereby they determined to ſtay a while and reſt themſelves till day appeared. Mean time the two knights deſired <hi>Urganda</hi> to ſhew them how ſhe came thither, and whether ſhe knew the country. My good friends (ſaid ſhe) having long ſince learned by my art, that this little child ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſéeing it was time to put my enterpriſe in practiſe, I went out of my Barque, and making as if I had béen robbed by certain thieves, ran towards them, crying out and wéeping bitterly, wherewith they all came forth to ſée what it might be, and perceiving me in that manner asked the cauſe of my grief. Ha my lords (ſaid I) it is ſo, that as my husband &amp; I paſſed through this wood, we met eight thieves, that ſlew him, and not content therewith, have taken away my horſe and my budget, wherein there is a great ſum of money.

Which they believing to be true (not that they were moved with compaſſion for my loſs) but reſpecting their own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar benefit, hoping to get a Booty by them that had robbed me, ſcattered themſelves in companies to find them out, where they ſtayed ſo long, that the ſhepheard and his wife went out of the houſe, and thinking to have their parts, left me alone with the childe, that not long after I took in mine arms, and went away. But as it fell out, the nurſe came in, and miſſing the child, called to them for help, who running in great haſte, followed me ſo faſt, (that had it not bin for night that overtook them) and the great fire you found about me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> I had never eſcaped their hands. And what would they have done with this poor infant (ſaid <hi>Manley?</hi>) You ſhall underſtand (ſaid ſhe) that the Son of <hi>Garadan</hi> having conceived a mortal hatred againſt the Emperor, either becauſe he could not have the Entertainment he thought he had deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or elſe grieved (as I think) that he could not attain unto the Empire, as he pretended: determined not onely to revenge himſelf upon this little childe, but to kill the Emperor likewiſe if ever he have the means. By God (ſaid the king of <hi>Denmark</hi>) he is a wicked and cruel-hearted man, but aſſure your ſelf that God will not permit it to be ſo. Nevertheleſs I am in doubt this childe will endure much woe, ſéeing you have no means to give it ſuck. Let me alone with that (ſaid <hi>Urganda</hi>) for I have certain herbs about me, with the juice whereof I will nouriſh it, if néed be, eight days together. What (ſaid he) will you then ſtay here ſo long? No (ſaid <hi>Urganda</hi>) for as ſoon as it is day I will return unto my Boat that ſtayeth here at the ſhoar.

My friends (ſaid ſhe) you muſt firſt let de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny have his courſe, and endure many hard adventuces, &amp; when time ſerveth you ſhall have your deſires. And in that manner ſometimes talking and ſometimes ſléeping, they paſſed the time away till day began to appear, when they thrée together went to the Sea-ſide, where they entred into <hi>Urgandas</hi> Boat, wherein four Gentlewomen and two Dwarfs ſtayed for her.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>FOr a time <hi>Urganda</hi> ſtayed with the two Knights, not mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſently to eaſe the Emperors minde with the recovery of his Son, in the end ſhe cauſed them to return unto their Barque, willing them from that time forwards to arm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the aſſaults of fortune, although ſhe ſéemed never ſo variable and unconſtant. For (ſaid ſhe) therefore was the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Knighthood inſtituted and appointed, that thereby it might appear more excellent. And they were no ſooner departed, but ſhe ſet foot on land, and mounted on a palfrey with the childe in her lap, ſhe rode forward, with two Dragons to guard her, one upon her right hand, the other upon the left, that bare her company till ſhe came to <hi>Triol,</hi> where the Emperor held his Court. And approaching the Town, ſhe met great companies of knights that went to ſéek the childe, who ſéeing thoſe horrible beaſts caſting fire out of their mouthes, for fear they began to flie, whereat <hi>Urganda</hi> ſmiled. At laſt <hi>Floreſtan</hi> King of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia</hi> coming that way, (having ridden a great compaſs about to purſue <hi>Garadans</hi> ſon) and returning as then all weary and ſore travelled, with his horſe tyred, perceiving the people to run ſo faſt, asked them the cauſe, wherewith they ſhewed him a far off what they had ſéen: but he not abaſhed, went towards the Dragons, thinking if it were poſſible, to fight with them, and as he came nearer unto them, he knew <hi>Urganda,</hi> and ſpurring his horſe, he thought to ſalute her, but the more he prickt him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the more the horſe gave back, whereby he was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to light down, and ſaluting her, he took her by the hand, but the Dragons vaniſhed away, whereat he was abaſhed, which <hi>Urganda</hi> perceiving, ſaid unto him, In faith ſir knight, they have good cauſe to give you place, knowing well the magnanimity of your invincible courage.

And for that the Emperor being armed, was ridden out to ſéek the childe, as others did, ſhe ſent men on all ſides to certifie him thereof; he having intelligence, thanked God with all his heart, and turned back to ſée <hi>Urganda,</hi> that told him in what manner ſhe found the childe, as you have heard before.

And that which abaſhed them moſt
<pb facs="tcp:57308:40"/>
was, that night coming upon them, it was ſo dark, they could not ſée the length of their boat, in which torment they continued for the ſpace of thirty days together, till at the length it caſt them upon an Iſland, where (being arrived about San-ſetting) they landed. Then commanding one of their Squires to keep their boat, being armed at all points, they went into the Iſland to ſée if they could finde any freſh water, or other victuals, for they had not ſufficient in their barque to ſerve them for a wéek: at the laſt they found a goodly fountain, ſhadowed with many great trees, whereby they ſat them down, and putting off their helmets for to drink, <hi>Argenton</hi> their Squire that was with them, ſaid unto them: if you think good, you ſhall ſtay here while I go up this high rock, where (it may be) I ſhall find a houſe, or ſome countrey man that will ſhew us in what place we are arrived. Go (ſaid the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>) but take héed thou looſeſt not thy ſelf. With that the Squire left them, and took his way through the wood, but he had not gone a long bowes ſhot, when he perceived a great Bear coming towards him, wherewith he was in ſuch fear, that with a loud voice he cried out for help, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no other remedy, he was conſtrained to climb into a high trée. The knights hearing their ſquires cry, ſuppoſed he had néed of them, and with that they ran in ſuch haſte to help him, that forgetting their helmets behind them, left them by the fountain, and they had not run far, but they eſpied the Bear climbing againſt the trée, wherein the Squire was deſending himſelf as well as he could, but the beaſt forſaking her firſt prey, ran un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Manley,</hi> being next unto her, thinking at the firſt encounter to throw him on the ground, but he ſtepping aſide, gave her ſuch a blow with his ſword, that therewith he cut off one of her ears, with a piece of her jaw, but the Bear turned again, and taking him moſt fiercely ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:57308:40"/>
companion, they two help their Squire <hi>Argenton</hi> to come down the trée, who as yet for fear trembled like a leaf, whereat they both began to laugh, <hi>Manley</hi> aſking him if he were a cold: no (ſaid he) but I was in the greateſt fear that ever I had in all my life, or ever I hope ſhall have again: and ſurely I believe there are no other people in this Iſland, than devils diſguiſed in ſtrange forms, or elſe ſuch proper Gentlewomen, as ſhe that of late im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced you ſo courteouſly, wherefore I am of this opinion, that for our better ſecurity, it were beſt for us to ſtay by the fountain, or in our barque till the ſea be ſomewhat pacified. In truth thou ſayeſt well (ſaid the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>) but in the mean time be thou of a good courage, and fear nothing. I know not what courage I ſhould have, (ſaid he) but I pray you for Gods ſake let us be gone, unleſs you will ſée me die here. As far as I ſée (ſaid <hi>Manley</hi>) thou wilt never die in fight, as long as thou findeſt means to run away. Not if I may (ſaid <hi>Argenton</hi>) for if I ſhould, it were done but like a fool. In which manner talking together, they came unto the Fountain, where they eſpied two old apes caſting their helmets (they had left behind them) one at the other, as lightly as if they had bin at Tenniſe, whereat the two knights &amp; <hi>Argenton</hi> laughed ſo heartily, that they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt overcome with laughter: for the apes had no ſooner ſpied them coming, but in great haſte they put the helmets on their heads, and climbing up the trées, ſkipped from branch to branch, ſometimes up and ſometimes down, like two tumblers. As God help me (ſaid <hi>Manley</hi>) I like theſe apes well, for they knew we were ſo melancholly on the ſea, that they meant to make us mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on land, yet I truſt they ſhall not carry away my Arms with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Combate. Wherewith they took up ſtones, and threw at them, but they turning about, grinned with their téeth, making mouths and mowes, ſometimes ſcratching their arſes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> took ſuch pleaſure, that he deſired <hi>Manley</hi> and <hi>Argenton</hi> to let the apes alone, &amp; as then it began to be night Wherefore they ſent the ſquire to fetch his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt of the victuals they had in their barque, becauſe the ſea roſe ſo high, that they doubted their barque would be caſt

on ſhoar, and break in pieces, who ſtayed not long before they came again, and after the knights had eaten of ſuch victuals as they had, they put off their armor, and ſlept till the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when they awaked, finding their helmets lying by them, but not their Armor, for thoſe new men of war had put them on ſo properly, that by their countenances it ſéemed they had ſome great combate to fight one againſt the other, in the top of the high Elms, whereof there were great plenty. But that ſport liked not the two knights, that were loath to die in that place for want of food, but made their account, either to put themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain unto the mercy of the waves, or elſe go further into the Iſland to ſéek meat. Wherefore making bows of wood, which they ſtringed with their garters, and cutting arrows to them, ſharp at the points, they ſhot at thoſe woody champions, ſo long, that at the laſt they compelled them to skip down, whereby they took them, and pulled off their armor, which done, they let them go, not doing them any hurt.</p>

               <p>YOu heard before how the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Manely</hi> were by fortune caſt upon the Iſle of Apes, where their boat was caſt away, they having not victuals longer then for two days, but God holp them, for the next day as they were upon the top of one of the higheſt rocks, they perceived a ſhip at Sea, which being driven with the wind, not long after was caſt upon the ſhore hard by the place where they were. Wherewith the two Knights went down to ſpeak with them that were abord, and calling with a loud voice unto them, there appeared a man upon the hatches, that asked them what they would.

My lords (ſaid ſhe) if you can do ſo much with this Giant that he grant me liberty, I will conduct you thither, and ſhew you ſtrange adventures they have done, which I am ſure (if they be your friends) will like you well. With that <hi>Manely</hi> deſired the Giant <hi>Frandalo</hi> to give the Gentlewoman liberty, but he ſéeing him ſo earneſtly intreat, began to laugh, and ſaid unto him: Before you eſcape out of my hands, it may be her intreaty for you will much more avail with me, then yours for her ſhall do. In the mean time I will provide you both of an honorable eſtate within my Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, making you Knights of the order of mine eares, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others that have béen there long time. You ſpeak at your eaſe (ſaid <hi>Manely</hi>) being in a place for your advantage, ſo do not we, that expect not any favor either on land or ſea, having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther boat nor victuals to receive us, but if you be the man you boaſt your ſelf to be, either come out to fight with us, or elſe ſend us a boat, and which of us two you choſe, ſhall come and heal you of the pride, that maketh you ſo hardly know your ſelf: Vpon condition nevertheleſs that you alone ſhall fight with him, and as fortune favoreth the combattants, the gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhall go with him that remaineth victor. Content (ſaid <hi>Frandalo</hi>) although I know full well, I ſhall win but little honor to fight againſt ſuch lacquies as you are: which he ſaid, in reſpect the eldeſt of the two Knights had not above ſeventéen years of age: wherewith he cal'd for his ſhield, and entring into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Barque he took from the Gentlewoman, went on land, where calling the two Knights unto him, he ſaid: Children, pity your own yong years, and rather yield your ſelves unto me, otherwiſe you are both dead without all remedy. Thou art mad (ſaid <hi>Manely</hi>) we are yet ſtrong and in good health, and how eſtéemeſt thou
<pb facs="tcp:57308:42"/>
us to be dead that were never ſick? In good truth, I hope before the cake be parted, to make thée King of the unhappy wretches: Wherefore chooſe either me or my companion to fight with thée mean time the other ſhall enter into thy Barque to kéep the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman thou haſt refuſed me. Alas poor man (ſaid <hi>Frandalo</hi>) it appeareth well thou knoweſt not what is good for thée: for if two of the beſt Knights in all <hi>Aſia,</hi> had undertaken this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate againſt me, I would make no more account of them, then a wolf doth of the ſhéep. By reaſon then, you that are ſuch beard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs boys, what can you look for at my hands? We look to break thy idly head (ſaid <hi>Manely.</hi>) Truly (ſaid <hi>Frandalo</hi>) ſéeing thou haſt ſo good a courage, I will give thée the honor to fight with me, for the laſt that ever thou ſhalt have. And if thou thinkeſt good, ſend thy companion to entertain the Gentlewoman, for as I ſuppoſe he is better made for ſuch a matter. With that <hi>Mane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> took the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> aſide, and ſaid unto him: You have heard <hi>Frandalos</hi> words, I pray you grant me the combate, and go you into the ſhip, and as it pleaſeth God to proſper me, do after what you ſhall think convenient. The king of <hi>Denmark</hi> perceiving it in vain to ſtrive, entring preſently into the boat, wherewith the Giant landed, and with the ſame boarded the ſhip wherein the Gentlewoman was. With that the two knights prepared themſelves to fight, but before any blows ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>Manely</hi> ſaid to <hi>Frandalo,</hi> Giant I pray thée leave us the Gentlewoman &amp; her Barque, and before thou ſpéedeſt worſe, we give thée leave to ſayl where thou thinkeſt good. Art thou afraid already? (ſaid <hi>Frandalo.</hi>) Ask me mercy, and I will ſave thy life, otherwiſe be thou aſſured, I wil hang both thée and thy compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the top of theſe high trées Defend thy ſelf then (ſaid <hi>Manely</hi>) wherewith they covered themſelves with their ſhields, and began the combate, though (as it ſéemed) far unequal, for that <hi>Frandalo</hi> on his mothers ſide iſſued from the ſtrongeſt race of Giants in all <hi>Turky,</hi> &amp; of his father of the valianteſt knights in all the world. And <hi>Manley</hi> yong &amp; unexpert in arms, having never béen in fight but when he ſuccored <hi>Urganda,</hi> yet the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant blood of <hi>Childadan</hi> king of <hi>Ireland</hi> his father, wrought ſuch force in him, that he had rather die then indure the leaſt ſpot of
<pb facs="tcp:57308:43"/>
diſhonor, and well perceived <hi>Frandalo</hi> he had not to deal with a childe, as he eſtéemed, but rather a Knight hardy as a Lion, and one that uſed him in ſuch manner, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his ſhield being hewed and his armor all unbuckled, at every ſtroke he drew blood from his body, in ſuch abundance, that the graſs was died therewith, whereat thoſe in the ſhip were much abaſhed, eſpecially the king of <hi>Denmark,</hi> that never thought to finde ſuch proweſs in his friend <hi>Manely,</hi> but the Gentlewoman that knew <hi>Eſplandians</hi> force, as likewiſe theirs ſhe left in the caſtle on the mountain, ſéeing <hi>Manely</hi> and his companion armed in the like arms, made her full account (if they were of the <hi>Ferm Iſle) Frandalo</hi> could not long reſiſt. Wherefore ſhe ſaid to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> In good faith ſir knight, I am well aſſured it will not be long before I be delivered, for <hi>Frandalo</hi> waxeth very weak, ſée you not how he beginneth to recoil? You poor ſlaves (ſaid ſhe) what think you thereof? I think it will be now or never that you muſt be frée. Whereat they all began to look up, perceiving the Giant ſo wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that recoiling back, he ſaid unto <hi>Manely,</hi> Knight, thou art not able to reſiſt me long, wherefore yield thy ſelf, or elſe thou dyeſt. I grant the like to thée (ſaid he) if thou wilt deliver us the Gentlewoman and her Barque, with all thou tookeſt from her, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe thou muſt do better then hitherto thou haſt done, if thou mindeſt not to loſe thy head. It is too well guarded (ſaid the Giant) and as he would have ſpoken more, <hi>Manely</hi> lifted up his ſword, charging him with greater fury then before. Wherewith <hi>Frandalo</hi> (aſhamed to ſée himſelf ſo hardly handled by him whom he made ſo ſmal account of) put forth all his ſtrength, in ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as at that inſtant <hi>Manely</hi> was ſore wounded, but the more he felt himſelf hurt, the greater grew his courage, eſpecially when he felt the blood run within his harneſs, ſo that with an accuſtomed fury, all fear clean laid aſide, he ſet ſo fiercely on his enemy, that he conſtrained him to turn his back, running to wards the Sea, wherein he waded to the ſhoulders, and <hi>Mane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> after him, but being lower in ſtatute then the Giant, could not enter ſo far into the water as the Giant, unleſs he ſhould have drowned. In the mean time four of the ſaylers entred into the boat, and with all ſpéed went to fetch him aboard, wherewith
<pb facs="tcp:57308:43"/>
the boat, and with all ſpéed went to fetch him aboard, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the ſlaves brake their chains, and with the aid of the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſet upon the Pirate, and others that held <hi>Frandalos</hi> part: whereof the greater number were thrown into the Sea. Which <hi>Frandalo</hi> perceiving, thought to ſpéed no better, but he determined by fair means to obtain that, which his force had utterly denyed him. Wherefore with a weak and féeble voice he called to <hi>Manely</hi> &amp; ſaid: Sir knight, If I have offended, I pray you pardon me, for what I have done to you, was onely in hope to win the praiſe, that ſuch as haunt arms moſt commonly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. Wherefore by reaſon you ought to bear with my unhappy fortune, and ſhew ſome courteſie in my behalf, eſpecially for that I am ſo wounded, that my life cannot be long. <hi>Frandalo</hi> (ſaid <hi>Manely</hi>) I grant thée thy requeſt, upon condition thou be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to my will: which the Giant ſwore to do. Then <hi>Manely</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> to take him into the ſhip, and give order to the Surgion to cure his wounds, which done, he prayed him to ſend the Barque again to fetch him aboard.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How the Knights being in <hi>Frandalos</hi> ſhip, (ſtaying for calm wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) deſired the Gentlewoman to ſhew them to whom ſhe appertained, and what ſhe had ſeen done by the Knights whereof ſhe ſpake.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe combate ended as you heard before, and the Knights aboard <hi>Frandalos</hi> Ship, ſtaying for calm weather, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſitting at the foot of his companions bed, (who as then was not fully healed of his wounds) deſired the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman to ſhew him where ſhe had ſéen <hi>Talanque</hi> and <hi>Ambor.</hi> My Lords (ſaid ſhe) being well aſſured that you are their friends I can certefie you for truth that I left them in good health, and in ſuch a place where they have obtained honor, and had not ſo ſoon forſaken them, if at the commandment of the beſt knight in the world, I had not béen ſent (when <hi>Frandalo</hi> took me) to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whether (if it pleaſeth you to bring me) I will there ſhew you what ſtrange things he did, I being preſent:
<pb facs="tcp:57308:44"/>
till then I pray you crave it not at my hands, otherwiſe you ſhall do wrong both to him and me. God forbid we ſhould (ſaid the King:) with that they called him that accuſed them, <hi>Frandalo</hi> asking him how he knew them, that he durſt affirm a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his maſter which they never once ſo much as thought. The Squire fearing death, fell down at their féet, and ſhaking like a leaf, ſaid unto them, My Lords, I beſéech you be not abaſhed, if I ſought to revenge my maſter, that long ſince was ſlain by two Knights, wearing the like arms. Where was it (ſaid <hi>Manley?</hi>) Hard by the place (ſaid the Squire) <hi>The defended Mountain,</hi> where I found this Gentlewoman ſpeaking to a Knight unar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, with whom I left her to go unto <hi>Matroco</hi> and <hi>Frerion,</hi> but at that inſtant I underſtood that a Knight armed all in black had ſlain them both, and conquered their Caſtle. For certain (ſaid the King) it was <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> for he wore ſuch armour, and for him onely as I think that victory was reſerved. With that the Gentlewoman began to ſmile, which <hi>Manley</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, ſaid unto her, Gentlewoman, I charge you by the faith you owe unto the thing you love beſt in all the world, ſhew us what you know of him. The thing I love beſt in the world (ſaid ſhe) is he of whom you ſpeak, for the reſt require it not at my hands, for you hear no more of me before I be in the place where he hath ſent me, we will bring you thither the ſooner (ſaid the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>) wherewith he called the Patron of the ſhip, asking him in what time they might be at <hi>Conſtantinople?</hi> if we have a good winde (ſaid he) I will bring you thither in leſs then four days. But <hi>Frandalo</hi> feared that more then any thing in the world, for he had robbed ſo many of the Emperors ſubjects, that he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for no pardon at his hands. Whereupon he deſired the two knights rather to caſt him into the ſea. For (ſaid he) I know, if he once lay hold on me, he will put me to moſt cruel death: but he ſhall not (ſaid the king) rather will we die in your defence, for you ſhall ſpéed no worſe then we. Wherewith the Giant thanked them, and as they were deviſing together, the winde came good, then the Patron cauſed the ankers to be hoiſed up, and ſetting ſayl, put to ſea, with ſo proſperous weather, that within four days after about break of the day, they diſcovered the City of
<pb facs="tcp:57308:44"/>
                  <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> entring into the Haven. Then the two knights asked the Gentlewoman what ſhe would do. My lords (ſaid ſhe) I have expreſs commandment from my maſter, to ſpeak unto the Emperor and the lady <hi>Leonorine</hi> his daughter, to whom I pray you let me be conducted, and in their preſence I will ſatiſfie your requeſt in that you have deſired at my hands. Wherewith they iſſued out of the Ship, taking <hi>Frandalo</hi> with them, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to preſent him to the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine,</hi> to whom they went (becauſe the Emperor was ridden abroad two miles from thence to chaſe a Hart) and finding one of the Princeſs Squires at the gate, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſpake unto him and ſaid, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion I pray you tell the Princeſs that I and this knight have brought a ſtrange lady unto her, that if it were her pleaſure would gladly ſpeak with her. With that the Squire went in and ſtaid not long before he came again, leading them into the Princeſs chamber, where they found her in company of Quéen <hi>Minoreſs,</hi> with divers other Ladies and Gentlewomen, but ſhe was eaſie to be known among them, for in beauty ſhe ſurpaſſed them all, <hi>Manley</hi> and the king of <hi>Denmark</hi> thinking they had never ſéen a fairer Princeſs, whatſoever men reported of <hi>Oriane, Olinde,</hi> or lady <hi>Briolaine.</hi> And as they entred into the chamber, ſhe ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped forth to receive them, wherewith they knéeled down to kiſs her hands, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſpeaking unto her and ſaid: Madam, we are two knights of <hi>the Ferm Iſle,</hi> that by ſtrange adventure were driven into the Mediteranian Sea, where we expected nothing elſe but death, but in the end having indured a great tempeſt for the ſpace of thirty days, and as many nights together, when our victuals began to fail, we landed in an iſland unhabited, where our veſſel brake in pieces, ſo that we percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing but death before our eyes (and altogether deſperate of any ſuccor) by fortune the ſhip wherein this knight and this Gentlewoman (pointing to <hi>Frandalo</hi> and <hi>Carmelle</hi>) ſayled, was by the ſame tempeſt of weather, caſt upon the Iſle where we not long before had landed, where there happened a marvellous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate betwéen him and my companion, and my ſelf with ſome of his Pirates in the ſhip, who by force I overcame: and my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion was victorious of the Giant. And underſtanding by this
<pb facs="tcp:57308:45"/>
Gentlewoman, that ſhe had a meſſage to deliber unto you from a Knight armed all in black, (whom we ſought after) we deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to bring her to your preſence, and withal to ſalute and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor the Emperor your father, in regard of the ſervice that my Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> oweth unto you, whoſe ſingular friends and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willers we are and always will remain. And for that at this time we have not any thing (beſides our ſelves) more worthy the preſenting to your Grace then <hi>Frandalo</hi> our priſoner, we moſt humbly beſéech you to receive him into your ſervice, and be a means to ſave his life, as we have promiſed him. The Princeſs <hi>Leonorine</hi> glad of that preſent, for the renown of the Pirat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accounted a man of great power and experience, thanked them moſt heartily, and calling one of her officers, ſhe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to entertain the two Knights in the beſt manner he could, as alſo to look unto <hi>Frandalo,</hi> until the Emperors return, who (ſaid ſhe) will be glad of their arrival, ſpecially to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by them ſome news of <hi>Amadis,</hi> mean time ſhe kept the Gentlewoman with her.</p>

               <p>THerewith the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Manley</hi> departed from her preſence, the Gentlewoman remaining with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, that led her into her privy chamber, asking her of what place ſhe was, and from whom ſhe brought a meſſage unto her? Madam (ſaid <hi>Carmelle</hi>) being perſwaded that as yet you know not him with whom I ſerve, I moſt humbly beſéech your Grace to pardon my holdneſs, if before I name him, I give you to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that whereas he is accounted among the ranck of the moſt valiant Knights living in the world, of whom by reaſon of his great courteſie and valor he is no leſs eſtéemed, then feared &amp; redoubted of all villains y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hear him named.

But knowing not if his ſervice would be accepted of, he durſt not preſume to come himſelf in perſon to offer you the ſame: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (by him that next after your ſelf, may moſt command him) he had expreſs charge to preſent it unto you, as bound thereto by promiſe. And to the end you may give credit to my words, he ſendeth you this ring, which is the very ſame you gave to <hi>Amadis,</hi> being in this Court, if your Grace can call it to remembrance. With that <hi>Leonorine</hi> took it in her hand, and beholding it long time, ſhe ſaid unto the Gentlewoman: Truly this ring was ſometimes mine, which I gave unto the beſt Knight now living in the world. In faith (ſaid the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) a better Knight then he hath ſent it you again, and that is my Lord <hi>Eſplandian</hi> his ſon.

<pb facs="tcp:57308:46"/>
whereat all the company began to ſmile, thinking that want of civility cauſed her to forget her ſelf. But not long after they changed their opinion, <hi>Carmelle</hi> beginning to ſpeak in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. My Lord, I have béen nouriſhed all my life among the beſt Knights living in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, yet let not your grace find it ſtrange if at the firſt (being in your Majeſties preſence) I have uſed ſo little honor to your Grace, whereby your Gentlewomen ſhould have cauſe to laugh at me: For that want of underſtanding how to behave my ſelf in preſence of ſo great a Prince, is not the cauſe thereof, but onely the joy I conceive in my ſelf, to be a ſervant unto him, whom I more eſtéem then any man living: and I onely hold for my lord and maſter, not knowing any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier then he. And if it pleaſeth your Grace to know who it is, together with the cauſe of my arrival in this country, I pray you ſend for the two knights brought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> me hither, &amp; I wil ſhew ſuch things, whereat (it may be) your Grace will be abaſhed. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman (ſaid the Emperor) you ſhall therein do me great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Wherewith he commanded a Gentlewoman to go fetch the two ſtrange knights, who coming into the Emperors preſence, having kiſſed his hands, and he welcomed them in courteous manner, he willed two chairs to be brought, wherein he ſet them, being a Prince that alwaies entertained ſtrangers with great honor, eſpecially if he knew them to be of forrain coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. That done, all the Knights, Gentlewomen, and Ladies went néer to hear the Gentlewomans ſpéech, when ſhe tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning unto the Emperor, ſaid in this manner: My Lord, I think your Grace hath long before this time known the Caſtle, called <hi>the defended mountain,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which (during the life of valiant <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadaque,</hi> and ſince that time) you and the king of <hi>Turky</hi> have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times aſſayled to win, although in vain, it hath alwaies béen ſo well defended by the Giants <hi>Matroco</hi> and <hi>Frerion,</hi> yet in one day a knight alone hath conquered it, &amp; ſlain the two giants whereof I ſpake, with their uncle <hi>Arcalaus</hi> and <hi>Argantes</hi> the Porter of the ſame. And which is more, hath delivered King <hi>Lui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart,</hi> that lay priſoner therein, no man knowing it, for he had béen ſurpriſed in great <hi>Britain,</hi> and ſecretly brought from thence by <hi>Arcabonne</hi> Lady of the Caſtle: The which lady falling in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,
<pb facs="tcp:57308:46"/>
threw her ſelf out of a window into the Sea. And to the end your Grace may know how all hath happened: it is ſo (ſaid ſhe) that <hi>Arcabonne</hi> (who as then I ſerved) having intelligence of her brothers impriſonment in the Ferme Iſle, departed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly from the Caſtle, hoping to deliver him, but before ſhe got thither, he was ſet at liberty. Notwithſtanding (ſhe being loth to looſe her labor) to be revenged thereof, did ſo much by her Art, that ſhe got king <hi>Luiſart</hi> (as then hunting in the forreſt) into her Tent, the king thinking to ſuccor a Gentlewoman, that as he thought a knight would have deflowred: where he was ſo cruelly inchanted, that loſing all his ſenſes, he was tranſported with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mans knowledge into the dungeon of the Caſtle, where my lord and maſter found him. And continuing her diſcourſe, ſhe ſhewed in what manner <hi>Eſplandian</hi> was made Knight, and ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to find ſhe king, was carried by the boat of the great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent into the Iſle of the Enchantreſs, where he conquered the ſhining ſword, and after that brought in a little barque to the foot of the rock called <hi>the defended mountain,</hi> the ſpéech he had with the Hermit, the combats with <hi>Argantes, Matroco,</hi> and <hi>Frerion,</hi> the deſperateneſs of <hi>Arcabonne,</hi> the determination ſhe had to kil him, when ſhe found him ſléeping in the hermitage, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> love wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe was ſuddenly ſurprized. And laſtly, the means how king <hi>Luiſart</hi> knew him: for (ſaid ſhe) he is ſon of <hi>Amadis</hi> his ſon, and of the Princeſs <hi>Oriane.</hi> And becauſe at his departure from his father he gave him command to come and ſerve the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine</hi> your daughter, with the other Ladies, according to his promiſe, he hath expreſly ſent me hither, humbly beſéeching them to pardan the ſtow performance of his fathers will: but to amend his fault committed, he wil ſhortly be here to fulfil his charge as long as they pleaſe. Gentlewoman (ſaid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor) I knew his father for one of the beſt knights in the world: notwithſtanding you have ſhewed ſuch ſtrange things of his ſon, that I certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe he far ſurpaſſeth him. He ſhall be heartily welcome when he cometh, but if my daughter will follow my counſel, ſhe ſhall not pardon his long abſence till he come in perſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the ſame: and let him be aſſured he ſhall not depart ſo ſoon from hence as <hi>Amadis</hi> hath done. At the leaſt, we will make him
<pb facs="tcp:57308:47"/>
ſo good chéer, and my Daughter likewiſe, to whom I give ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs commandment to do it, that he ſhall not have occaſion to diſlike our company. Mean time the two Knights ſhall remain with us for pledges, aſſuring you I will give them all the honor and good entertainment that I can deviſe. My Lord (ſaid ſhe) the deſire they have to underſtand the things declared to your Grace, hath cauſed them for to come hither, with whom by great good fortune I met; for <hi>Frandalo,</hi> whom he (pointing to <hi>Manley</hi>) hath moſt valiantly conquered, had taken me priſoner, not far off from the place where I firſt imbarqued: but as fortune would, there aroſe ſo great a ſtorm at ſea, that all his Veſſels ſeparated one from the other, his ſhip was caſt upon an Iſland, wherein (by the ſame tempeſt) theſe two knights not long before arrived. And with that he ſhewed what ſpéech they had with <hi>Frandalo,</hi> and what paſſed betwéen them: Wherefore my Lord, acquitting my promiſe made unto them, I have at large declared the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the good knight their companion: In faith (ſaid the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror) they have ſhewed themſelves right valiant knights, and made a worthy preſent unto my daughter, for which I give them thanks. My Lord (ſaid <hi>Manley</hi>) we humbly beſéech your Grace, that from henceforth you will accept his ſervice, for it is his only deſire, as he hath promiſed us. Is that poſſible (ſaid the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror?) For he is the vildeſt villain that ever lived on earth, and hath more wronged my ſubjects then ever any did. My Lord (ſaid the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>) he will become a new man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my companion did preſent him to your daughter, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed for to ſave his life, which we beſéech your Grace likewiſe to perform. I am content to do it (ſaid the Emperor) at your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, though he deſerves it not. While they ſat talking, <hi>Gaſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> that ſtayed in the forreſt to look unto the hounds, entred into the Hall, and preſently knew <hi>Manley</hi> and the king of <hi>Denmark,</hi> having ſéen them in <hi>Great Brittain</hi> before they were made Knights, wherewith he asked them when they came thither? and being made acquainted with the Gentlewomans meſſage, he asked her if ſhe knew the names of the other two that ſtayed in the Caſtle? for ſéeing they are armed (ſaid he unto <hi>Manley</hi>) in the like Arms, it is certain they are of your company. That is
<pb facs="tcp:57308:47"/>
true (ſaid the Gentlewoman) for they were all made Knights together, the one called <hi>Ambor,</hi> the other <hi>Talanque.</hi> I know them well (ſaid <hi>Gaſtilles</hi>) for <hi>Ambor</hi> is the ſon of <hi>Angriote d'eſtrauaulx,</hi> one of the beſt knights in the Countrey of <hi>Great Brittain.</hi> In truth (ſaid <hi>Manley</hi>) we were in great care how to finde them out, but ſéeing they are in the Caſtle called <hi>The defended mountain,</hi> if it pleaſeth the Emperor, we will go unto them. I am content (ſaid he) ſo you promiſe me not to depart before eight days are paſt. My Lord (ſaid they) we are at your commandment. Being Dinner time, the Emperor roſe up and went into the Hall with the two Knights, and the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine</hi> took the Gentlewoman with her, as deſtrous to hear further news of the Knight <hi>Eſplandian.</hi>

                  <p>What paſſed between the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine</hi> and <hi>Carmelle,</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Meſſage ſhe had brought.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>YOu heard before how <hi>Carmelle</hi> in preſence of the Emperor, ſhewed the great deſire ſhe had to ſlay <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> and when ſhe thought to do it, ſhe was ſo overcome with love, that during her life ſhe determined not to love any other, which the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Leonorine</hi> (that already pretended part in him) had not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, but returned with <hi>Carmelle</hi> into her Chamber: with a ſmiling countenance ſhe ſaid unto her, Is it poſſible Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (ſaid ſhe) you loving the knight with the black arms ſo well as you report, that you could leave his company ſo ſoon? Madam (ſaid ſhe) I was preſently given to underſtand he loveth another: wherewith I comforted my ſelf, judging his heart like unto mine own, that he could not chuſe but ſometimes féel the like ſwéet paſſion he cauſed me indure. What hope then reſteth (ſaid the Princeſs) unto you? The ſame (ſaid ſhe) I know to be far different betwéen him and me, for when I am in preſence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the excellency of his perſon, I then receive ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, which to him is utterly denied, ſéeing that already he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for her ſake, that as yet he never ſaw, and that (Madam ſaid ſhe) is your own perſon, as I ſaid before. Surely (ſaid the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs)
<pb facs="tcp:57308:48"/>
his love is very ſtrange, the foundation whereof I cannot well conceive. Madam (ſaid <hi>Carmelle</hi>) I fear e're it be long, he will not be able to indure the great extreamity wherein he now is fallen, onely for your ſake eſpecially, if at his arrival here, he finde himſelf rejected of your Grace, having no deſire, but to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil your pleaſure, whereby he may account himſelf your own, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtéeming it the greateſt favor, that ever he can have. In good faith (ſaid ſhe) I will not refuſe him ſo ſmall a thing, nor a greater, as occaſion ſerves, but I pray you tell me why he calleth himſelf the black Knight. That can I not well do (ſaid <hi>Carmelle</hi>) onely that upon a night as king <hi>Luiſart,</hi> he, <hi>Talanque</hi> and <hi>Ambor,</hi> were all aſléep in one chamber, they heard ſo pleaſant a ſound of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick from the ſea, that they roſe out of their beds to hear it, and it was ſo dark they could not ſée, but when day appeared, they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpyed the great Serpent at the Haven, whereat they were ſo glad, that deſcending down the hill, they went unto the ſhoar, where they perceived a Gentlewoman in a little boat coming to land, bearing in her arms a pack covered with blew Taffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta: which from her miſtriſs <hi>Urganda</hi> ſhe preſented to <hi>Eſplandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> ſaying unto him, Sir Knight, my miſtriſs ſendeth you theſe arms, and willeth you by me to leave the ſame ſhe gave you, when you were in ſadneſs, and to arm your ſelf with theſe, that bear the deviſe of her, which at this day is the beautifulleſt creature living in the world (as <hi>Amadis</hi> your Father well did witneſs, when he ſet the Crown upon her head.) And for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> love of her your power and courage ſhall ſo much increaſe, that your renown ſhall ſpread throughout the world, your mind moved with ſo amorous a paſsion, that many times you ſhall deſire death. And opening the packet, ſhe took forth a white armor all ſet with Crowns of gold, inriched with Pearls and Diamonds moſt ſumptuous to behold: which <hi>Eſplandian</hi> (with hearty thanks unto <hi>Urganda</hi> and the meſſenger) received willingly. This as I think madam (ſaid <hi>Carmelle</hi>) is the cauſe, why he hath bin cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the black knight, but I ſuppoſe ſéeing he hath changed his deviſe, he will likewiſe change his name. The Princeſs <hi>Leono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> knew thereby, that all theſe things were ſaid as touching her, wherewith ſhe felt an alteration in her mind, for that love
<pb facs="tcp:57308:48"/>
by little and little began to burn her heart, which ſhe had wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly covered, but <hi>Carmelle</hi> by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> changing of her colour, which ſometimes waxed pale and ſometimes red, the ſundry motions wherewith ſwéet love did prick her tender heart, perceived it full well in ſuch manner, that being no longer able to abſtain from ſighing, as if he had ſpoken to her ſelf, ſhe ſaid I pray God this beginning may prove a happy end. Wherewith <hi>Carmelle</hi> perceiving her maſters ſute to proſper with effect, the better to increaſe the deſire of the Lady, ſhe ſaid unto her: Madam, he hath commanded me not to ſtay long here, for till my return he doth continue in excéeding pain, and never ſhall be frée if he receive no comfortable anſwer from your Grace. Gentlewoman (ſaid the Princeſs) I were the moſt ungrateful Princeſs living on the earth if I ſhould do ſo, but tell him I pray you from me, that I give him hearty thanks for the courteſies he offereth me by you, and when he once arriveth here, he ſhall ſoon know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great good will I bear him. As alſo that I hold him for my knight, for proof whereof, you ſhall on my behalf preſent him with this hair lace, as being the firſt preſent that <hi>Grimanaiſe</hi> my grandmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gave to his <hi>Appolidon,</hi> being but her lover. Wherewith ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a cloth of tiſſue from her hand, ſhe unbound her hair, and delivered the hair lace unto her, and ſending for a gown imbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all with Crowns of Gold, gave it her likewiſe. But (ſaid ſhe) becauſe the two Knights have promiſed the Emperor not to depart from hence till eight days are paſt, you ſhall ſtay for them, and all together return unto the Caſtle called <hi>the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded mountain,</hi> which ſhe willingly granted.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How news was brought unto the Emperor, that <hi>Armato</hi> King of <hi>Turky</hi> had beſieged the Caſtle of <hi>the defended Mountain,</hi> and of the charge he gave <hi>Frandalo</hi> with <hi>Manley,</hi> and the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> to go ſuccor it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN manner as you heard before, the two Knights of <hi>the Ferm Iſle</hi> and <hi>Carmelle,</hi> ſtayed at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where there arrived a certaine Ship, that brought a Squire on
<pb facs="tcp:57308:49"/>
meſſage from <hi>Talanque</hi> and <hi>Ambor</hi> to certifie the Emperor, that <hi>Armato</hi> King of <hi>Turky,</hi> advertiſed of the death of <hi>Matroco</hi> had beſieged the Caſtle, <hi>the defended mountain</hi> both by land and Sea, deſiring him to ſend ſome aid, otherwiſe they ſhould be conſtrained to yield the ſame, not having victuals nor men for to defend it. The Emperor hearing thoſe news, and conſidering the truce betwéen him and the King of <hi>Turkes,</hi> as alſo that he had not any men prepared for to ſend, neither Gally, Galliace, Ship nor Brigandine ready for the Sea, ſtood ſomewhat in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze. But conſidering with himſelf of what importance that Frontier Caſtle might be unto him if the enemy ſhould obtain it, he determined by all means to hinder him from the ſame. Wherefore calling for <hi>Frandalo,</hi> and taking him aſide, he ſaid unto him: Well <hi>Frandalo,</hi> you are now my priſoner, and it lieth in me either to hang you like a thief, or deliver you with greater riches then ever you poſſeſſed, which I promiſe you to do, if from this time forwards you ſwear to be my loyal ſubject, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſerve me when you are imployed My Lord (ſaid he) I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſéech you Grace wholly to forget the faults by me committed to your Majeſty, ſwearing of my faith, (if it pleaſeth you to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my offence) you ſhall from henceforth finde a ſervant of me, that in time will make you know by effect how much I eſtéem this favor at your hands. Will you do it (ſaid the Emperor?) I and it pleaſeth your Grace (ſaid he.) What is become of your Navy (ſaid the Emperor) that in times paſt you held up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sea? My Lord (ſaid <hi>Frandalo</hi>) the windes and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts that lately happened on the ſea, hath ſo ſcattered them, that I can hear no news of them: Nevertheleſs, I am of opinion, they may eaſily be brought together, wherewith I will do your Grace ſervice, if you think good. Do it then (ſaid the Emperor) and that with ſpéed, for I have determined to raiſe the greateſt army that ever hath béen ſéen, therewith to drive <hi>Armato</hi> king of <hi>Turky</hi> out of the Frontiers of my Empire, whom not long ſince hath beſieged <hi>the defended mountain.</hi> And while my forces are preparing, you with the two knights that of late came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhall go before, and uſing meanes to aſſemble your men, ſhall in the mean time give the <hi>Turkes</hi> ſomewhat to do. My
<pb facs="tcp:57308:49"/>
Lord (ſaid <hi>Frandalo</hi>) God give me grace to do you faithful ſervice: then be you ready in the morning (ſaid he) to depart from hence, wherewith he commanded <hi>Frandalos</hi> ſhip to be rigged and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with al things neceſſary, and finding <hi>Manley</hi> and the king of <hi>Denmark,</hi> he told them that he had received news from <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanque</hi> and <hi>Ambor</hi> touching the caſtle of <hi>the defended moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> and what he had determined to do as concerning their relief, ſhewing them what had paſſed betwéen him and <hi>Frandalo</hi> touching the ſame. Wherefore my good friends (ſaid he) becauſe I wel perceive the great deſire you have to ſée your companions, me thinketh it were good you imbarqued your ſelves with him, who goeth before to advertiſe them of the aid I mean to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (ſaid the king) you ſhall have your Barque ready and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with all things neceſſary, and ſome other of my ſhips likewiſe to ſecond you, attending the great army my ſelf doth mean to bring. But before their departure he gave them divers rich preſents, which they refuſed, contenting themſelves with the honor and courteous entertainment he had already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them, and taking their leave of all the court, eſpecially of the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine,</hi> they took Sea, and <hi>Carmelle</hi> with them, hoping to have her maſters great good will for the good news ſhe brought him. But before we paſs further to ſhew you what became of them, I think it not out of our Hiſtory to leave <hi>Eſplandian</hi> no longer at <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> but ſhew you what became of him, being healed of his wounds.</p>

               <p>MAny days and nights did <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ſtaying at <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> after the dangerous combate betwéen him and <hi>Amadis</hi> his father, before his wounds were fully healed. But in the end having licence of the king &amp; others that might command him,
<pb facs="tcp:57308:50"/>
he took his way towards <hi>the Ferm Iſle,</hi> accompanied of maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> &amp; <hi>Sergil.</hi> And travelling without any adventure worth rehearſing, at the laſt they arrived at the palace of <hi>Apolidon,</hi> at the foot whereof they found the great Serpent, wherein preſently they imbarqued themſelves, but ſhe removed not from thence till midnight following, when ſhe began to ſayl ſo ſwiftly, that the next day they were out of ſight of any land, and ſo continued for ſeven days together, the eight day they diſcovered a goodly country, and having a calm wind the Serpent put a ſhore, which <hi>Eſplandian</hi> perceiving, determined to land and walk along the coaſt, till he found ſome one or other that could ſhew him in what countrey he had arrived. And deſtring maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> not to depart thence before he came again: he, <hi>Sergil,</hi> and their two horſes entred into a little Boat, and taking land, they entred ſo far into the countrey, that they came to a little hill, at the foot whereof they perceived a goodly meddow, and certain houſes, whereunto they went. And they had not ridden far, but a Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy that kept four horſes, whereof one was a Bay, and greater than the reſt, came unto <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> and ſpeaking to him in the <hi>Almain</hi> tongue, asked him why he went to his own miſchief? <hi>Eſplandian</hi> that in his youth had learned that Language, asked him wherefore?

He uſeth (ſaid he) to kill or put in priſon far braver fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows than your ſelf: wherefore if you will believe me, you ſhall return again, if you mean not to ſpéed as I have told you. But <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ſtaying not, paſſed forward till he came unto the door, where he eſpied a Giant ſet at dinner, and four ſquires all bare-headed waiting on the board. But as ſoon as the Giant ſaw him, he roſe up, and leaning on the cloth, ſaid unto him: Thou un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy wretch, who hath ſent thée hither in my preſence, armed as thou art? By my great god <hi>Janos,</hi> I muſt néeds ſay thou art a fool, or elſe art weary of thy life. Come hither to me, and put off thine Armor, becauſe thou ſhalt not have ſo much pain to go on foot to thy lodging that is prepar'd for thée. Forwards you vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, ſaid he unto his ſquires, throw him off his horſe, and carry
<pb facs="tcp:57308:50"/>
him to his fellows. Wherewith one of them (thinking to play the diligent ſervant) ran unto <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> to ſerve him for a Squire: but (whether <hi>Eſplandian</hi> was offended, or for that he had the left ſtirrop in ſtead of the right) he gave him ſuch a blow on the face with his Gantlet, that he felled him to the ground: whereat the Giant was in ſuch a rage, that he ſcarce had the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to arm himſelf to be revenged. Wherefore ſending to fetch his great Bay horſe, mounted thereon. Mean time <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> lacing his helmet, took his ſword in hand, ſtaying for his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy that ceaſed not to threaten him, who ſtayed not long before he came, bearing a great lance upon his thigh, and ſo great a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miter hanging at his ſadle how, that a ſtrange man would have much ado to liſt it up. But as you ſée a Cock holding up his head, and ſtanding ready to receive another Cock wherewith he fighteth, ſo <hi>Eſplandian</hi> having felt the injury he had received at the giants hands, ſéeing him approach, began to ſhake his leg, ready for to charge his enemy. But the Giant called him, and ſaid, Vaſſail, content thy ſelf with the honor thou haſt already gotten, by putting me in ſo great choler, that without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard I have taken arms againſt ſo vile and wretched a thing as thou art: Flie then from hence without conſtraining me to do thée any hurt, otherwiſe thou art moſt ſure of death, for twenty knights hardier then thy ſelf, cannot once remove me. <hi>Eſplandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> hearing his great brags, made no account thereof, but in moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery ſaid unto him, Thoſe thou haſt already <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That ſhalt thou preſently ſée (ſaid the Giant) and couching his launce, ran towards <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> who did the like againſt him: But the Giant miſſed his blow, ſo did not <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> for with the force of his blow he made the Giant double his body, in ſuch ſort, that his Gaul brake in his body, and ran out at his mouth, wherewith he preſently
<pb facs="tcp:57308:51"/>
died. They that beheld it were thereat abaſhed, ſpecially the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants Squires, who preſently began to flie, but they had not run far, when <hi>Eſplandian</hi> overtook them, threatning to ſlay them if they would not ſhew him the place where their maſter kept his priſoners, which they promiſed to do. And leading him along by the foot of the Hill from whence he had deſcended, they came into a narrow way full of ſtones where ſtood a watch of twenty men all armed, each man with a hatchet in his hand to defend the paſſage: when the captain of that band perceived the Giants ſquires coming towards them, he asked them where they found that unhappy fellow? and ſaying ſo, thought to lay hands upon <hi>Eſplandians</hi> bridle, but with a blow of his ſword he cut his arm in ſunder, wherewith the reſt ſet all upon him. But in ſhort time he dealt ſo well among them, that he laid moſt part of them dead upon the ground. But he had ſo many men about him, that in the end his horſe was ſlain, and he in danger to be overthrown. Yet he behaved himſelf ſo valiantly, and with ſo great a courage, that he remained Victor, his enemies flying as faſt as poſſibly they might: and among the reſt, the lacquy that he found kéeping the four horſes, who ſaving himſelf in a vault, cried with a loud voice, and ſaid, Come forth my Lord, come forth, your ſon <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mato</hi> is ſlain, and all our companions likewiſe. With that there appeared a great old Giant with a long white beard, who ſéeing <hi>Eſplandian</hi> with his ſword bloody in his hand, and moſt of his men lying dead about him, he caſt cut a great ſigh and ſaid, O immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Gods, wherein have I ſo much offended you, that you ſhould ſuffer my onely ſon, and all my men to be ſlain in ſuch manner by this one knight? But I hope your wraths will not be ſo much increaſed againſt me, as that yeu will not give me leave to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on him. And as he uttered theſe words, being covered with his ſhield, he went unto <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> and holding his ſword in hand, ſtroke him flatling with the ſame upon the arm, in ſuch maner that he was aſtoniſhed: and with the force of the blow the ſword ſliding down upon a ſtone, brake in thrée pieces, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ſtepped to him, and with great dexterity ſtruck him ſo fiercely on the face, that the blood in great abundance ran out of his forehead. Whereat the Giant was in ſuch a rage, that
<pb facs="tcp:57308:51"/>
caſting down his Shield, took the piece of his Sword in both his hands, and with all his force ſtroke at <hi>Eſplandian</hi> that ſtept aſide, and perceiving the Giants arm coming towards him, with one blow cut off his hand, whereby his Sword fell down. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs he ſéemed not abaſhed, but imbracing <hi>Eſplandian</hi> with his left arm, thought to cruſh the breath out of his body, but it happened otherwiſe, for as he held him, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> having his right arm at liberty, thruſt his Sword into the Giants body, wherewith he died. Then calling <hi>Bramatos</hi> thrée Squires that he brought thither to ſhew him the priſoners, he asked where they were: My Lord ſaid one of them, on that ſide the vault is the two Giants lodgings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that you have ſlain, and under it are the priſoners that you ſéek in a moſt dark priſon above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred paces long, and but two paces broad, whereby the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners (in great number) have no means to reſt themſelves, being conſtrained to ſtand upright for the narrowneſs of the place. Go before (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) with that the Squire went forward, and <hi>Eſplandian</hi> followed after, and they had not gone long, but they entred into a goodly pallace, and going lower, he heard the lamentable voices of the poor priſoners dying for want of food, whereat he took ſuch compaſsion, that the tears ran down his eyes, asking the Squire for the keyes? There they hang (ſaid he) upon a nail. Open the door (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) which he preſently did, wherein they entred, and <hi>Eſplandian</hi> calling the poor wretches that lamented, ſaid unto them, My good friends, come all forth, and thank God for your liberties. You may well judge if they were glad to bear thoſe news, for that ſome of them had remained therein above thirty years together, being in all twenty Gentlewomen, thirty Squires, and fifty Knights, among the which <hi>Eſplandian</hi> knew <hi>Grandalin</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinde,</hi> who by evil fortune (after the conqueſt of <hi>Sanfuegue</hi>) tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling the country, were met by the Giants, and kept in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with the reſt, where they indured great miſery.</p>

It was then about Sunſetting, and <hi>Eſplandian</hi> had neither eat nor drunk of all that day, wherefore he determined not to depart thence till the next day in the morning, for he found great ſtore of victuals in the place: Commanding <hi>Sergil</hi> with one of the Squires to go ſéek the Bay horſe he left at the houſe where he ſlew <hi>Bramato,</hi> for his own was ſlain, which they preſently brought unto him, paſsing the night in the Giants houſe with the beſt victuals they could finde.

In truth (ſaid <hi>Norandel</hi>) the peace made betwéen <hi>Amadis</hi> and the king, I departed from the Court to ſéek ſome ſtrange adventures that commonly are found in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Almaigne,</hi> where I had no ſooner arrived, but I had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain news of my fathers abſence, whereat I was ſo grieved, that to find him out I have travelled the countries of <hi>Denmark, Poland, Ruſſia, Swethland, Hungary,</hi> and all this country, even unto this place, where it is ſaid there dwells two Giants, who as they are all of one nature, exerciſe innumerable cruelties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe they méet, the yonger of them waiting continually about this place for ſuch as paſs this way. And therefore when I ſaw you firſt, I thought one of you thrée to be the Giant, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to fight with him, or loſe my life therefore: which I wil yet do if you let me paſs. By God (ſaid <hi>Gandalin</hi>) you loſt your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor ſéeking for the King, ſo ſhall you likewiſe do if you take this enterpriſe in hand? Wherefore, ſaid <hi>Norandel?</hi> Becauſe (ſaid he) you ſée him here in preſence that eaſeth you of that burthen. With that he ſhewed him in what manner <hi>Eſplandian</hi> had fought with the Giants, and how he, <hi>Lazinde,</hi> and diverſe others were priſoners in their houſe, from whence <hi>Eſplandian</hi> had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them. Before God (ſaid <hi>Norandel</hi>) the news liketh me well, for I never thought in long time any ſuch adventure would have happened unto him, not knowing he had received the order of Knighthood. You ſée it ſo (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) and maſter <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> can tell you more, if it pleaſeth you to go with us. Let us go then (ſaid <hi>Norandel</hi>) for I would gladly ſée him: With that they rode towards the Sea, till they eſpied the great Serpent wherein they imbarqued themſelves: where <hi>Norandel, Grandalin</hi> and <hi>Lazinde,</hi> underſtood by maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> what had happened to <hi>Eſplandian</hi> from the day he received the order of knighthood. And although <hi>Norandel</hi> determined with all ſpéed to return into great <hi>Britain,</hi> yet he changed his mind when he heard ſo ſtrange and marvellous news of his Nephew <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> to whom he ſaid: My Lord, ſéeing fortune hath brought us ſo well together, I pray you let me not leave your company till ſome occaſion be

In that manner they paſſed the reſt of the day in the great Serpent, minding the next day becauſe ſhe ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not, to take land again to ſée if they could find any more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures: And they had ſcarce fallen aſléep, but the Serpent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of it ſelf to ſayl forward ſo ſwiftly, that by ſun riſing they had loſt the ſight of any land, not ceaſing for to ſayl ſix days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether before they eſpyed land: the ſeventh day when the Sun began to ſhine, it ſtayed at the Iſle Saint <hi>Mary,</hi> which maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> preſently knew, having bin there before with <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> when he fought with <hi>Landriaque:</hi> wherefore he ſaid unto the Knights, In good faith, I remember that once as I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled on the Sea with my lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> we were caſt upon this Iſland by ſo great a tempeſt, that we thought verily to have béen drowned: And if then at ſea we had great fear of death, being landed, our fear did more increaſe, and that with ſo good cauſe, that I cannot chuſe but tremble to remember it.

Sir (ſaid maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) ſome men to hide the truth, make a great matter of a ſmall, but if you had ſéen as much as I then ſaw, and that which as yet you may behold, if it pleaſeth you to go where I was once, you ſhall find that I have no leſs occaſion, and there is <hi>Grandalin</hi> that can witneſs it as well as I. I pray you bring us thither (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) with that they cauſed the horſes to be unſhipt, and going to land, they mounted up the Iſland, til they came to the caſtle where <hi>Amadis</hi> ſtayed certain days to be healed of his wounds, where they found a knight that kept it for the Emperor, who being advertiſed by maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> what knights they were he had brought thither, bad them heartily welcome, offering them all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he could ſhew, but they ſtaying not there, went forwards to the place where <hi>Amadis</hi> fought with <hi>Landriaque,</hi> where the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror had erected both their Images ſo like unto them, that there wanted only life to expreſs the ſame: Which maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſhewed unto the knights, and to the end (ſaid he) you believe me better another time, I pray you behold well the form of this great devil, who before my lord <hi>Amadis</hi> arrived had utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed

And therewith he ſhewed them from point to point what had paſſed touching the ſame, as you have heard at large ſet down in the third book of this our Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whereat they were all abaſhed, eſpecially to think how <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driaque</hi> could be ſlain or overcome by one knight alone; For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this image were but a ſenceleſs thing, yet it made them abaſhed, which having long time beheld, and viſiting other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces worthy memory, they returned to the great Serpent, which preſently departed from the Iſle, and with a good winde, in five days after arrived within half a mile of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where it began to caſt forth fire in ſo furious manner, that the ſailers and others that perceived it, flew all away, doubting the fury of that monſter, wherewith the Citizens were in ſuch a fear, that news was brought unto the Emperor who as then was talking with the Ladies, whom he led unto the towers of his pallace to ſée what it might be, when they perceived the great Serpent, and the Sea raging ſo ſore about it, that it ſéemed a gulf of fire, wherewith they were in ſuch a fear, and the Emperor likewiſe, that he commanded all men to be armed, fearing it would come into the Town, and ſo deſtroy them all. But <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> that had ſéen it oftentimes, aſſured the Emperor that it was the Ship of the knight <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> which <hi>Urganda</hi> brought firſt into great <hi>Britain.</hi> And to the end my Lord (ſaid he) you ſhall not doubt thereof, if it pleaſeth you I will go ſée if the ſon of <hi>Amadis</hi> be there, and bring him unto you. Do ſo I pray you (ſaid the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.) With that <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> went unto the Haven, entring into a Gally that he found ready to put to ſea, commanding the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter thereof to row unto the great Serpent, but whatſoever he could ſay, the maſter would not ſtir one foot, till ſuch time he threatned him with fear of being hanged.

I would to God, that we being both together, might never depart out of thy body: for being with him, his onely preſence would bréed in me ſo much contentment, that I ſhould think my ſelf to have attained unto the top of all felicity: and if his love be ſuch as <hi>Carmelle</hi> hath aſſured me, it cannot be, but that he ſuffereth the like paſſion I now endure, by overmuch deſire to ſee his perſon. Wherewith ſhe remained in ſuch an extaſie, that by the changing of her colour, it might eaſily be judged her heart was not at eaſe, which in the end compelled her to ſigh, and at the ſame inſtant to repent the ſpeeches ſhe had uſed unto <hi>Carmelle,</hi> as alſo of the rich gown that ſhe gave unto her.

But if <hi>Leonorine</hi> were in pain, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> had no leſs, both ſolicited with like jealouſie, for the great diſtruſt of their not méeting at that time: and gladly would have approached née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to each other, had it not béen that the one was on land under the government of another man, the other at ſea within a beſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel which he could not command. In the mean time the great Serpent ſetting forwards, made ſuch ſpéed, that in very ſhort ſpace it paſſed the <hi>Straights of Boſphore.</hi> Wherewith the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Leonorine</hi> was like to ſwoon but ſhe refrain'd it as much as poſſible ſhe might, fearing to manifeſt that, ſhe moſt deſired to kéep ſecret. Whereby ſhe withdrew her ſelf half dead into her Chamber, and making as if ſhe deſired to ſléep, threw her ſelf on her bed, commanding her Gentlewomen to depart the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: they being gone, ſhe began again to renew her ſorrow, and almoſt drowned in tears, ſaid unto her ſelf: Alas, now I ſurely ſée and well perceive my grief to be wholly without remedy, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſéen the thing (that in all the world I moſt entirely love) ſo néer unto me, and at one inſtant ſo ſuddenly to depart, that it is uncertain whither he is gone. Ha cruel torment: that ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth in me ſo covertly, is it poſsible that from henceforth I can ſo well diſſemble as yet I have done? Truly no: for if in time paſt I inforced my ſelf to eſtéem the deſire I had a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar pleaſure unto me, now ſéeing I well perceive my accurſed fortune to approach, and my joy to fade, in manner as ſoon as it was conceived, I deſire nought but death: which to me would be more acceptable, then live in ſo great pain, not hoping any eaſe. And leaving ſo, ſhe gave ſo great a ſigh, that Quéen <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> heard it: Who fearing ſhe had been ſick, opened the chamber door, asking her how ſhe did? Wherewith the Princeſs percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that diſcovery, to excuſe her ſelf the beſt ſhe could, ſhe told the Queen ſhe dreamed. Madam (ſaid the Queen) it is not long ſince the Empereſs ſent to ſee what you were doing? Is it not your pleaſure to riſe and go unto her? Let us go (ſaid ſhe.) In the mean time <hi>Eſplandian</hi> with his companions ſayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo long, that within two days after they perceived the Rock of <hi>the defended Mountain,</hi> and not far from them the Veſſels

But <hi>Manely</hi> and the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> that had ſéen it often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times before, were very glad, giving them to underſtand what ſuccor they might have thereby, whereat they all rejoyced, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when they perceived <hi>Eſplandian, Gandalin,</hi> and the reſt, that <hi>Manely</hi> and the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> knew, wherefore cauſing a boat to be made ready, they with <hi>Frandalo</hi> &amp; <hi>Argenton,</hi> the king of <hi>Denmarks</hi> ſquire (a very good mariner) entred into it, and row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the great Serpent, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> received them with great joy, asking <hi>Manely</hi> what fortune had brought them thither. In faith (ſaid he) it is not long ſince we departed from the City of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to diſcover and to hinder the paſſage of victuals that are daily brought by ſea from the town of <hi>Notolia</hi> to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mato</hi> king of <hi>Turks,</hi> who not long ſince hath beſieged the Caſtle of <hi>the defended mountain,</hi> expecting daily the coming of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror with a great Army to drive the Turk from thence. But we have had ſo contrary a wind, that it hath bin impoſſible for us to effect our charge. In good truth (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) I would never have ſought you in theſe Countreys, neither do I know what became of you after we fell aſléep in this Veſſel, I pray you tell it us. Then <hi>Manely</hi> began to ſhew how he and the king of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> when they awaked found themſelves in a barque upon the coaſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> where taking land they found <hi>Urganda,</hi> and after that by cruel tempeſts they arrived in an Iſle, where a Bear aſſailed them, in which Iſle they ſaw two great Apes that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them much ſport. But (ſaid he) we thought to have ſtarved therein for want of meat, for our victuals were clean conſumed, when by fortune <hi>Frandalo</hi> arrived in the ſame Iſle, with whom I fought, and overcame him. And becauſe our barque was caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, we entred into his, wherein we found a Gentlewoman that told us news of you, whom for your ſake we conducted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and from thence have brought her back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.

I pray you (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) come to land, and go with us into the caſtle, where we will confer of all things with ſome better leiſure: Which he agréed unto, wherewith he &amp; ſome of the principal cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of his army, entred into the knights boat, and with them went up into the caſtle: where being arrived, <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> knew king <hi>Armato,</hi> deſired <hi>Eſplandian</hi> before he did any thing elſe, that he might ſée him, wherewith he brought him to the chamber, where he ſate as penſive as any man could be, <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> did him honor, as to his eſtate appertained. But king <hi>Armato</hi> would hardly look upon him, but ſaid unto him: <hi>Gaſtilles,</hi> I marvel much why the Emperor your maſter (contrary to his faith and promiſe) hath broken the peace agréed upon betwéen us, and for a thing ſo little importing him as this place doth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he never had any right, as you well know. But I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from whence the ſame procéedeth: becauſe he would every man ſhould know ſhe little faith and leſs loyalty that is in him, which I ſhall one day make him know full well, if ever I eſcape out of this priſon. My Lord (ſaid <hi>Gaſtilles,</hi> your honor ſaved) the Emperor my maſter hath in him all the parts that belong unto a wiſe vertuous, and hardy Prince, ſuch as he is, and it ſéemeth unto me (under your correction) that by good and juſt cauſe he hath done no more then he might do: ſéeing it is evident that this caſtle hath bin conquered by Chriſtian knights, whom
<pb facs="tcp:57308:61"/>
he is bound to favor with all the aid he can, not onely to defend our Law, or becauſe they have deſired his aid, as being the firſt and greateſt Monarch in the world, but to ſuſtain the right that both he and his Predeceſſors have alwayes pretended to theſe Marches. And where you threaten to make him féel the ſmall Loyalty whereof you accuſe him, at other times heretofore you have met each other with your Forces, where you ſped ſo hardly, that I rather believe you ſpeak in choler then with reaſon, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering the eſtate wherein you are at this preſent. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilles</hi> (ſaid <hi>Armato</hi>) although I were dead, I have ſufficient number of Captains and good Soldiers in my Countrey to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge my Cauſe, and a ſon likewiſe, that is not born to endure the injury done unto his father: and thus much I aſſure thée, that if I thought him to be other, I would ſtay him with mine own hands as ſoon as I ſhould ſée him. My Lord (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) that Prince, Knight, or Gentleman that uſeth ſuch unfit ſpéech as you do now, is commonly holden for a man of no capacity, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when he is in a place where humility rather then threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings would become him better: Have you already forgotten the priſon wherein you are, and in the hands of thoſe that have ſo ſmall occaſion to wiſh you well? My lord, vertue is never better known to be in man, but then when he is in moſt diſtreſs: Wherefore if until this time you have not known what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy doth mean, learn hereafter to diſcern the ſame, uſing words worthy your eſtate, and not ſuch, nor ſo injurious as you have uttered unto my Lord <hi>Gaſtilles,</hi> who in this place repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the perſon of an Emperor, (a greater lord then you) in whoſe mercy your life or death conſiſteth: for we are all his ſouldiers, ready to do him ſervice. The king perceiving well that he had done them wrong, and fearing to be hardlier uſed then he was accuſtomed to be, ſaid unto <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> Sir Knight, I pray you pardon my impatience, conſidering with your ſelf the great grief and melancholy humor wherein I am, when I (that was wont to be feared &amp; redoubted of all the Princes in <hi>Aſia</hi>) am now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to obey the will and pleaſure of my greateſt enemies, which unto me is ſo extream grief, that I die each day a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times, becauſe I cannot die.

one word, but leaving him with his guard, taking <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> by the hand, led him into one of his beſt chambers, where they ſupped.

               <p>YOu have heard before of the Combate betwéen <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and <hi>Amadis</hi> his father, and how after long time of their abode at <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> ſtaying the healing of their wounds, <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> deſiring to return unto the Caſtle of <hi>the defended Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> took his leave of king <hi>Luiſart,</hi> the like did divers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knights that as then were at court: as <hi>Galaor</hi> king of <hi>Sobradiſe, Agraies, Granſador, Balan, Galuanes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Angriote d'eſtrauaulx,</hi> ſome to ſée their wives, others to taſt the eaſe and pleaſant reſt of their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion houſes: whereby it hapned the Court was leſs repleniſhed with knights than it had béen in long time before, eſpecially by reaſon of the news they heard from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> caſtle <hi>the defended moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> whither divers young knights travelled to aid <hi>Eſplandian.</hi> King <hi>Luiſart</hi> therefore ſo meanly accompanied as I ſaid before, being very old and decrepit, began to be melancholy, and to have the palſie, ſetting aſide all hunting, hawking, arms, and chival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or any other pleaſure whatſoever: And with a remembrance of death, ſo much abhorred all things paſt, preſent, and to come, that he eſtéemed them vain and altogether tranſitory: whereby he determined to depoſe himſelf of all kingly eſtate and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Realm, to paſs the reſt of his time in a ſolitary and religious maner, eſpecially when he called to mind the great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils
<pb facs="tcp:57308:62"/>
from whence he had eſcaped, and above all his laſt moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and cruel impriſonment. Nevertheleſs, for a time he kept it ſecretly, until one night he being a bed with the Quéen, where they lay talking of the fickleneſs of this world, he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his whole mind unto her, and how he determined to make <hi>Amadis</hi> his ſon King and Governor of his Country: to the end he might fréely and without any interruption withdraw himſelf to this caſtle of <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> where (by Gods help) he meant to live a ſolitary life. The Quéen that was one of the wiſeſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouteſt ladies in her time, confirmed him ſo well in his opinion, that they agreed to return to <hi>London,</hi> there to accompliſh their pretence. And the next day they departed from <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied of <hi>Amadis, Granſador,</hi> and others, and coming to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> after they had remained there a certain time, the Quéen ſent for all the nobility: who being arrived at the court, cauſed a ſcaffold to be made in the principal place of all the City where the people might repair.

advertiſed that he meant to go by night) they iſſued out of the caſtle, every man carrying victuals with him for the ſpace of four days: And they travelled ſo long, that about the break of day they came unto a great forreſt, where they ſtayed in ambuſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t till the next night following, when they iſſued forth, and about thrée of the clock at night they came unto a path that went two ways, where <hi>Frandalo</hi> cauſed them to ſtay, and calling <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> ſaid unto him: My lord, I pray you let us two and no more take the way that leadeth on the left hand, and <hi>Belleris</hi> my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew ſhall guide the reſt of our company to the mountain of <hi>Yarebreh,</hi> from whence they may eaſily ſée if our Navy be néer the city of <hi>Alfarin,</hi> and then as they finde the enterpriſe go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, they may aſſayl the place, or elſe remain in ambuſh till oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſerveth.

four or five of them unto the ground, forcing them that were behind to return again, wherewith there began a fierce and cruel battel, for thoſe that firſt began to run away (looking back and perceiving onely two Knights that ſet upon their fellows) were ſo aſhamed, that they turned again to help them: nevertheleſs without the force of thrée Giants that held againſt the knights, they could not have indured ſo long againſt <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> and <hi>Frandalo,</hi> but they thrée fought ſo valiantly with them, that the two knights were in the greateſt danger then ever they were before.

Madam (ſaid <hi>Frandalo</hi>) ſince y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time I became your knight, at the laſt Tourney that I ran, a lord of greater power hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained me into his ſervice, whom I wil ſerve during my mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal loſe, ſeeing it hath pleaſed him to ſhew me ſo great favor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wel aſſured, that when you know him as I do, you wil eſteem me happy, how cowardly or villainous ſoever you account me now. What is he (ſaid ſhe) tell me of your faith? it is Ieſus Chriſt (ſaid <hi>Frandalo:</hi>) yet will I never faile to do you all the honor and ſervice that I can, as alſo now at this time, ſo my companion be content, for without him I cannot do it. <hi>Frandalo</hi> (ſaid <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandian</hi>) you may command me, for I am ready to do what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth you: Wherefore delay not to do all the pleaſure &amp; ſervice you can unto this lady if it be your will. Wherewith <hi>Frandalo</hi> than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him moſt heartily, and ſaid to <hi>Heliaxe:</hi> Madam, ſeeing he will have it ſo, I pray you from henceforth put all your truſt in me, and I will not faile to be careful for you: Mean time I pray you get upon your palfry, that I may bring you to a place where you may ſee far better tourneys then any at your wedding: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward (if it pleaſeth God to favor us) you ſhall eaſily perceive how much I eſteem and have in remembrance the favors you have heretofore ſhewed unto me, being but a ſimple knight, and you a great Princes to command far better then my ſelf: for never was Princeſs more honored and eſteemed among her

own ſubjects then you ſhall be of them, to whom I mean to bring you, which may be an example unto Kings and mighty Princes, to whom God hath given power and authority, who being advertiſed of the honorable and good intertainment made to you by us, they may be moved hereafter to take pleaſure in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining the meaner as well as the greater, conſidring the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of fortune, as by your ſelf it well appeareth. <hi>Frandalo</hi> (ſaid ſhe) you may make as many excuſes and fair promiſes as you liſt, yet can you not deny but you have done me wrong, yet in doing as you ſay you will, your reputation will be better to the world, although your faith hath fayled to our goods: wherefore let us go where it pleaſeth you. With that ſhe got upon her pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey, and <hi>Frandalo</hi> bare headed leading her horſe, till they came neer unto the town, where they heard a great noiſe, that made the two knights think, either their enterpriſe to be diſcovered, or that their Souldiers aſſailed the Town. And fearing they had bin repulſed, began to repent themſelves of their long ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Princeſs, to whom <hi>Frandalo</hi> in moſt courteous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſaid: Madam, Is it not your pleaſure (mean time that I and my companion go unto the town) to ſtay here for us with this Gentlewoman and my couſin <hi>Foron?</hi> I truly (ſaid <hi>Heliaxa</hi>) and I will not depart from hence before I hear of you again. With that <hi>Frandalo</hi> and <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ran in great haſte towards the Town, where they found their companions fighting with thoſe of <hi>Alfarin,</hi> among the which were <hi>Talanque, Ambor,</hi> the King of <hi>Denmark, Gandalin, Lazinde,</hi> that had given the town a hard skirmiſh on that ſide, thinking to give them ſo much to do, that in the mean time the army by ſea might aſſayl the water gate: but they were too ſoon diſcovered, whereby they found great reſiſtance on all ſides: Nevertheleſs <hi>Norandel</hi> and <hi>Belleris</hi> had gotten the Barriers, and repulſed the enemies unto the palliſadoes Which <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and <hi>Frandalo</hi> perceiving, they lighted on foot, and being covered with their ſhields, their ſwords in their hands, paſſed through the preaſe, and with bold courage, went ſo far, that they ſlew great number of the enemies: for the <hi>Alfarins</hi> to defend their city iſſued out of the gates, and the Chriſtians to win it, did moſt valiantly, but the place was ſo
<pb facs="tcp:57308:66"/>
narrow, they could not hurt their enemies ſo much as in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>open field. Whereby it happened, that <hi>Frandalo</hi> and <hi>Eſplandian</hi> minding either to win or looſe, ſtepped ſo far forward, that the <hi>Alfarins</hi> flying into the town, and they after, found themſelves alone within the ſame among their enemies, and that ſo far, that had it not bin for <hi>Frandalo, Eſplandian</hi> (that took no care but only to kill and overthrow the enemy) had ben incloſed by them, put he pulled him back. Whereby the two Knights perceived the danger they were in, wherefore by little and little they got unto the ſteps, that went upon the wall: where they ſuſtained many hard aſſaults without being hurt, although the enemy cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to throw Launces, Stones, Darts, and all other wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons at them they could find, none of them daring come to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſtrokes, for if any advanced himſelf to ſhew his proweſs, it coſt him his life, or elſe was thrown down headlong. Mean time <hi>Norandel</hi> and his company, that had ſéen <hi>Frandalo</hi> and <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> ſhut into the town, ſought by all means to ſcale the walls, or elſe to break the gates: but all in vain, for they within defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it ſo with Oyl, ſcalding Water, Logs and Stones, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them were overthrown, and ended their lives moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably. And fighting in that ſort, a knight all armed came from the Haven, crying with loud voice and ſaid: Be of good courage my children, be of good courage, defend this quarter well, for our enemies on the ſea-ſide have not as yet found means to ſet one man on land, and yet have loſt above two hundred of their men. By God (ſaid one of them) I ſée not one that ſtandeth idle, yet can we not overcome theſe two knights. Why ſo (ſaid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other?) They are (ſaid he) entring in among us, and we have bin theſe two hours fighting with them, but all in vain, for the youngeſt of them fighteth ſo valiantly, that we dare not approach them: And which is more, he and his companion in deſpight of us all have gotten thoſe ſtairs, where they now defend themſelves, and that ſo wel that we can find no means to drive them thence although many of our men have béen ſlain by them, &amp; others cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly wounded. I am of opinion (ſaid the knight) that we receive them unto mercy, for it may be they are ſuch men, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for to have them again, the enemy will be glad to give king <hi>Armato</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:57308:67"/>
change, and return again into their country. Whereunto they all agréed, and therewith the Knight that had given them that counſel, made ſigns unto <hi>Eſplandian</hi> that they would parley with them, whereby the aſſault ceaſed for a time, and the knight ſpake unto them in this maner, Sir knights, you ſée it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for you to eſcape from hence, and it were great pity that two ſo valiant knights ſhould die ſo young now in the flower of your ages. But this we will do, yield your ſelves, and we will ſave your lives. Sir knight (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) if we die at this time, we are quit for ever after, but ſo much there wanteth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and we have ſo good hearts and ſo ſure a confidence in Ieſus Chriſt, in whoſe quarrel we fight, that we hope he will give us means not onely to eſcape this danger, but to ſpoil the Town and lead you priſoners with us: Wherefore take this counſel for your ſelves, and yield you unto us before the wrath of God be further moved againſt you. When they that ſtood about them beard thoſe words, both great and ſmall began to cry with a loud voice, ſaying: Stay that villain, let him die, or we will die here at his féet: wherewith they aſſailed them ſo fiercely, that they were conſtrained to get upon the higheſt ſteps. But not long after they repulſed the enemy ſo valiantly with ſtones (whereof they ſound great quantity upon the Portal) that from that time forwards they had no longer ſtomacks to aſſayl them. But <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randel</hi> and the reſt being without, underſtanding the noiſe and the voice of their companions, whom they eſtéemed dead or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoners, determined to ſet fire on the gates, while the reſt aſſailed the town: Wherewith every man ran to fetch wood, which the <hi>Alfarins</hi> perceived, but to conclude, they could not ſhun it, but whither they would or not, the Draw-bridge and the gates were ſet on fire: wherewith they were ſo abaſhed, that moſt part of them began to flie unto the great temple of <hi>Jupiter</hi> the principal place of ſtrength within their City, the reſt ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind, with full determination rather to die then ſuffer the Chriſtians to enter the Town. And ſéeing the gates burnt down, ſo many of them ran to fetch water, that not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Chriſtians had means to aſſayl the town on that ſide, which aſſault continued ſo long that day failed, yet could they not
<pb facs="tcp:57308:67"/>
enter, by reaſon of the great reſiſtance the <hi>Alfarins</hi> made, but the two Knights that were above did them ſo much hurt with blockes and ſtones, that not any of them durſt appear, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Chriſtians became maſters of the town. Wherein great number of people, both men, women, and children, were put to the ſword, &amp; more had died had it not bin night, ſpecially on the water ſide where <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> and his army entred with moſt great fury. Nevertheleſs fearing leſt the <hi>Alfarins</hi> ſhould aſſemble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and in the night they might be repulſed, be commanded a retreat to be ſounded, being well aſſured the next day to have the town at their pleaſure. And for the ſame cauſe he ſent to the army on land that they ſhould do the like: wherewith every man retired, ſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The town in this ſort being conquered, and the people gotten into the great temple of <hi>Jupiter, Eſplandian</hi> minding not to loſe the Princeſs <hi>Heliaxe,</hi> nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Giant <hi>Foron,</hi> that he and <hi>Frandalo</hi> left with <hi>Carmelle,</hi> deſired <hi>Grandalin</hi> and <hi>Lazinde</hi> to go fetch them, and with them he ſent <hi>Sergil</hi> his Squire to bring them to the place, which they preſently did, and made ſuch haſte, that they found her ſitting by a great fire that <hi>Foron</hi> had made, where ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off their horſes &amp; ſaluting <hi>Heliaxe, Grandalin</hi> ſaid: Madam, my lord <hi>Eſplandian</hi> prayeth you to come unto the place where he ſtayeth for you. My friends (ſaid ſhe) I know him not, true it is I was brought hither by two Knights, whereof one is <hi>Frandalo</hi> that I have known long time, but for the other I aſſure you as far as I remember I never ſaw him before. Madam (ſaid <hi>Carmelle</hi>) he is Son to the valiant Knight <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> whoſe ſame is ſpread ſo far about the world. Truly (ſaid <hi>Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axe</hi>) I have heard of him ſo have you (as I think ſaid <hi>Carmelle</hi> of my Lord <hi>Eſplandian</hi> his Son: for he alone conquered the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>the defended mountain,</hi> and now lately hath taken king <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mato</hi> your father in law, and I can aſſure you he is one of the courteous knights living-in the world. I am much abaſhed then (ſaid ſhe) how he ſhewed himſelf ſo uncourteous in my behalf, not ſpeaking unto me while I was in his company, yet me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth being his priſoner, he could have done no leſs then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me, either with good ſpeeches of fair promiſes, whereof he
<pb facs="tcp:57308:68"/>
hath uſed ſo few, that while I live I ſhall never think well of him. Madam (ſaid <hi>Carmelle</hi>) you take the matter otherwiſe then it is, for if he refrained to ſpeak unto you, it was by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the great acquaintance he perceived <hi>Frandalo</hi> to have with you, unto whom he is ſo great a friend, that he was not onely content to give him leave to entertain you, but much greater favor would he do unto him if he can. You may ſay what you will (ſaid ſhe:) Nevertheleſs, if he have no other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe then that you alledge in his behalf, he ſhall never loſe the diſliking he hath gotten at my hands. Madam (ſaid <hi>Gandalin</hi>) I am well aſſured he will amend that fault when it pleaſeth you, wherefore I pray you determine what you mean to do, for he hath commanded us to do as pleaſeth you: My friends (ſaid <hi>Heliaxe</hi>) I would gladly ſléep till it be day, then I will be ready to go where you think good, but I pray you tell me what noiſe it was I heard of late within the Town. Madam (ſaid <hi>Lazinde</hi>) It is not yet thrée hours ſince the Town was taken by aſſault. Good God (ſaid ſhe) what miſerable fortune was that for the poor inhabitants, I think they are all put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sword. No madam (ſaid <hi>Lazinde</hi>) the greater part have ſaved themſelves in the great Temple of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> but they will hardly eſcape when it is day, for our Generals are determined to burn the Temple. If it be ſo (ſaid ſhe) that <hi>Frandalo</hi> hath any credit with his companions, and that he that ſent you be ſo courteous as this Gentlewoman report him to be, I hope they will take pity on the poor people: at leaſt, if not for the love of them, I truſt upon requeſt for my ſake they will not refuſe it. And to the end I come not thither too late, I pray you when day appeareth let us preſently depart, wherewith laying her down upon a cloke, ſhe paſſed the reſt of the night, not greatly to her eaſe.</p>

                  <hi>HEliaxe</hi> that had not ſlept all that night, being grieved for the loſs of the town of <hi>Alfarin,</hi> the ordinary abiding place
<pb facs="tcp:57308:68"/>
of <hi>Alphorax</hi> her husband, and withal the pleaſanteſt and moſt delicious place of all <hi>Turky,</hi> perceiving day to appear, waked the two Knights, making her account if ſhe might get into the town before the deſtruction of the temple, the people that were fled into it, (by her requeſt and humble ſupplication to <hi>Eſplandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and <hi>Frandalo</hi>) ſhould be ſaved. With that they all mounted on their horſes, and made ſuch haſte, that they entred into the town, as the Chriſtians began to aſſault the fortreſs, and when <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalo</hi> perceived the Princeſs <hi>Heliaxe,</hi> he rode unto her, bidding her God morrow, and taking her palfry by the bridle barehead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, brought her to <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and his company that did her great honor, knowing her to be a Kings Daughter, &amp; wife to ſo great a Prince. With that ſhe asked <hi>Frandalo</hi> which of them was <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandian,</hi> Madam (ſaid he, pointing unto him) here he is ready to do you any ſervice that he can, as he hath aſſured me But when ſhe perceived him to be ſo yong and of ſo great beauty, ſhe was abaſhed to think how nature had furniſhed him with ſo many good perfections, eſpecially of ſo great and incomparable force, whereof he had the commendation among the moſt valerous Knights: wherewith ſhe ſaid unto <hi>Frandalo,</hi> In good faith I have heard him commended in divers places for one of the beſt Knights living in the world, and of mine own knowledge I have ſéen him, conſidering his yong years, ſo that if he abound as much in courteſie as he doth in valor and beauty, I think him to be the braveſt Gentleman that may be found: which I ſhall preſently ſée if he grant me one requeſt. Madam (ſaid <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandian,</hi> bluſhing at the praiſes ſhe uſed in reſpect of him) If I do it not, you ſhall be the firſt that ever I refuſed gift unto all my life: and conſidering your great beauty and moſt courteous behavior, how ſhould it be poſſible for me to diſobay your will? I pray you then ſir knight (ſaid ſhe) to pardon the poor people that are within the Temple, &amp; grant them unto me, with leave to ſend them where I ſhall think good, not hurting them any more. In good truth madam (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) you ſhall not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed for ſo ſmall a matter, and I will do ſo much with the other Knights, that they ſhall give conſent, as alſo to your own liberty and the Giant <hi>Forons,</hi> to guide you where it pleaſeth you, which

                  <hi>Frandalo</hi> did moſt earneſtly at your hands before you arrived here: And for his ſake look what elſe you will command at our hands, we are ready to perform it with all our hearts. For the which the Princeſs <hi>Heliaxe</hi> thanked him moſt heartily, &amp; turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Frandalo,</hi> ſaid unto him: Sir Knight, the good that you and your companions do unto me, ſhal never be forgotten on my part, but I will by all means ſéek to acknowledge the ſame, although preſently I cannot do i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>: wherefore if it pleaſeth you, cauſe your ſouldiers to retire, that theſe poor diſtreſſed people may come forth according to your promiſe: In the mean time I will go comfort them, for I am in doubt moſt part of them are rather dead then living: with that ſhe deſired <hi>Carmelle</hi> to bear her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, they two going to the Temple gate, which they found faſt ſhut and rampired up: then ſhe called ſo loud, that ſome of them ſpake unto her: but never did men by pardon from their Prince, brought back again from the Gibbet, more rejoyce, nor were better comforted then they when they knew her, thinking the Prince <hi>Alphorax</hi> had made ſome agréement with their enemies. Wherefore they opened a little wicket, whereat ſhe and the Gentlewoman enrered into the Temple, they sking the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs how it was her chance to come thither in ſo good a time to ſuccor them, that looked for no other favor then moſt cruel death.

And yet (ſaid ſhe, ſmiling) while I live I ſhall not forget the ſmall account you made of me when <hi>Frandalo</hi> and you found me before my pavillion, after the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of my Knights. Wherefore Madam (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian?</hi>) I marvel (ſaid ſhe) why you ask me ſuch a queſtion, ſéeing you might well conceive what grief I had in mind, yet did you not ſo much as once ſalute me, or uſe word unto me: in good truth it was but diſcourteouſly done of you. Madam (ſaid he) I beſéech you pardon me, for the fault I committed in your behalf, was not done for want of bringing up, but fearing to bréed ſome jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie in <hi>Frandalos</hi> mind, ſéeing him ſo much affected to do you ſervice, together with the good countenance you ſhewed unto him, although you had loſt your men. This excuſe (ſaid <hi>Heliaxe</hi>) is not to be accepted, neither ſhall you eſcape ſo eaſily therewith: which ſhe ſpake with ſo good a countenance, that her ſeeming to be offended, contented all the company: wherefore <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ſaid unto her, Madam, I am content to make amends for this great fault, or to do what pennance it pleaſeth you. The pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance (ſaid ſhe) that you ſhall have ſhall be, that according to the promiſe of mercy you have made unto theſe poor people, as alſo of favor in mine own behalf, you give us leave to go unto the City of <hi>Teſifant</hi> to my husband, that for the ſame we think the better of you. Madam (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) you have already under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood our minds, wherefore you may freely go whither it pleaſeth you, and I my ſelf will be your guide if it be your pleaſure. With that <hi>Heliaxe</hi> gave them many thanks, and taking her leave, got upon her palfrey, and being accompanied of <hi>Foron</hi> with a great number of the poor people, took the way that went to <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifant, Frandalo</hi> going with her above a league and more, and further would have gone although he were wounded in divers places of his body, but ſhe deſired him to go back again.

My lord (ſaid ſhe) when I ſhall have told you how, yet am I in doubt you will hardly believe it.

cauſed two Brigandines to go forth to ſée if they were friends or enemies: and they were not long before they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned again with the great Ship in their company, wherein were <hi>Palomir, Branſil, Helian le delibere, Garvate du Val Craintif, Bravor</hi> ſon of the giant <hi>Balan</hi> that king <hi>Amadis</hi> had newly made Knight, <hi>Imoſel de Burgoigne, Ledarin de Faiarque, Liſtoran de la tour Blanche, Trion</hi> couſin to quéen <hi>Briolanie, Tentilles le Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbe, Guil le bein eſteme Grodonan</hi> brother to <hi>Angriote deſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaux,</hi> and the two ſons of <hi>Iſamie</hi> Governor of <hi>the Firm Iſle,</hi> with many others that had imbarqued themſelves in <hi>great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> to go to aid <hi>Eſplandian:</hi> and coming to the Caſtle of <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Mountain,</hi> they had intelligence by the fiſhermen at ſea, of the overthrow of <hi>Armatos</hi> navy, his captivity, and the taking of the City of <hi>Alfarin,</hi> whereat they much rejoyced, eſpecially when they knew by <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> ſoldiers that not any of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions were ſlain in the aſſault. They being arrived at the Town, as they began to land, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> with divers others went thither to receive them: where betwéen them were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſalutations and welcomes given: which done, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> led them to his lodging, where they refreſhed themſelves about two hours before they went to viſit <hi>Frandalo,</hi> of whom <hi>Eſplandian</hi> gave ſuch commendations, that they deſired him to bring them where he lay, which he preſently did: but when <hi>Frandalo</hi> knew who they were (being aſhamed to ſée them uſe ſuch courteſie to him) could not well tell what to ſay: and as he entertained them, <hi>Palomir</hi> ſpake unto him, and ſaid: Sir knight, I and my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have heard ſo great commendation of your valor, that there is not one of us but would be ready to obey and ſerve you as our Chief Commander: wherefore, we beſéech you, uſe all diligence you may to be healed of your wounds, that we may preſently go into the field under your conduction. My Lords (ſaid <hi>Frandalo</hi>) I pray you pardon me, I am well aſſured that my valor is none ſuch as you report, whereby I deſerve not the praiſe you give me, neither did I ever any thing worthy commendation, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by my Lord <hi>Eſplandians</hi> means. Nevertheleſs I hope, if God ſpareth me life and health, ſo to behave my ſelf, that all men ſhall know the deſire I have to do ſervice unto Chriſtendom,
<pb facs="tcp:57308:72"/>
and particularly unto every one of you. Companion (ſaid <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>) I pray you take care to be cured of your grief: that done, we will take order for the reſt: and for that theſe Knights are weary with their long travel on the Sea, I pray you give them leave for to depart, and in the morning we will viſit you again. Which he ſaid, fearing leſt too much talk might cauſe him fall into a fever, for <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> before that had béen deviſing with him above two hours together, touching the conference betwéen him and <hi>Eſplandian</hi> as concerning his return unto the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. With that the Knights bad him farewel, and went out of the chamber: on the other ſide <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> made all haſte he could to depart from thence the next day in the morning, and taking leave of all his friends, the ſame night he entred into his ſhip: &amp; when day began to appear, he ſet ſayl with ſo good winde, that within eight days he diſcovered the city of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the haven: which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor underſtanding, went to receive him, &amp; going with him to the palace, asked him what he had done in his voyage, &amp; whether <hi>Armato</hi> were retired from the ſiege or not. My lord (ſaid he,) The good knight <hi>Eſplandian</hi> &amp; his company moſt humbly commend themſelves unto your Grace, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially <hi>Frandalo,</hi> whom I can aſſure you to be one of the beſt ſervants that ever you had. With that the Empreſs accompanied with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princeſs <hi>Leonorine,</hi> Quéen <hi>Minoreſſe,</hi> &amp; divers other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Gentlewoman came thither, to whom <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> doing humble reverence, they bad him welcome, and becauſe he ſtayed to do <hi>Eſplandians</hi> commendations to the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine,</hi> the Emperor ſaid unto him: Truly nephew, you ſhall make an end, to ſhew us what hath happened in your voyage, then if it pleaſe you, you may court ladies. Wherefore I pray you tel from the beginning what you have done. My Lord (ſaid he) at our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from hence we had ſo good a winde, that without any let we arrived at the caſtle <hi>the defended mountain,</hi> yet could we not make ſuch haſte, but that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> with his great ſerpent, and <hi>Frandalos</hi> ſhips had already drowned and overthrown cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the enemies ſhips, and made the reſt to flie, and the next day after king <hi>Armato</hi> was taken priſoner, his army over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown and put to flight: but the ſport was when I ſaluted the
<pb facs="tcp:57308:72"/>
                  <hi>Turk,</hi> and that he knew me, then he told the great rage the <hi>Turk</hi> was in, the threatnings and ſpéeches he uſed unto him, the overthrow of the twenty knights at the adventurous foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the skirmiſhes and aſſaults at the town of <hi>Alfarin,</hi> the danger wherein <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and <hi>Frandalo</hi> found themſelves, the taking of the town and of <hi>Heliaxe,</hi> her delivery with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that fled to the temple of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and how that before he imbarqued himſelf to return, a great ſhip arrived there from <hi>Great Britain</hi> with divers Knights therein, whoſe names and ſirnames he rehearſed, as having ſéen them with King <hi>Amadis.</hi> Further my lord (ſaid he) the good Knight <hi>Eſplandian</hi> willed me to ſhew you that he kéepeth King <hi>Armato</hi> till your Grace ſhall diſpoſe of him, as alſo the City of <hi>Alfarin,</hi> but for the Caſtle <hi>the defended mountain,</hi> he ſaith he mindeth not to yield the ſame to any other then to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princeſs <hi>Leonorine,</hi> in whoſe name he hath conquered it, hoping as her ſervant and no other to defend the ſame. When will he be here (ſaid the Emperor?) With all the ſpéed he may (ſaid <hi>Gaſtilles</hi>) as he hath promiſed me. In good faith (ſaid the Emperor) I would it were this day before to morrow, I have ſo great deſire to know him by reaſon of the great chivalry that daily increaſeth in him, in ſuch manner, that if heretofore the Knight with the Gréen Sword hath béen eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the beſt in all the world, now his ſon diminiſheth a great part of his glory. And all being well conſidered, I think that <hi>Amadis</hi> hath not done more in ten years time, then <hi>Eſplandian</hi> hath accompliſhed in the ſpace of ten wéeks: But touching <hi>Frandalo,</hi> is he ſo well diſpoſed to our ſervice as you make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port? My Lord (ſaid <hi>Gaſtilles,</hi>) It is not poſsible to do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then he hath done: wherefore, my Lord <hi>Eſplandian</hi> willed me to ſhew you, that for the better entertaining him in his procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, he is of adviſe that your Grace ſhould give him the City of <hi>Alfarin,</hi> not knowing any man worthier then he to kéep it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In good truth (ſaid the Emperor) <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and his companions have had the pains to conquer it, wherefore I am content they have the diſpoſing thereof: Nevertheleſs, if they reſt upon my conſent therein, I am well content it ſhall be ſo, and I will not ceaſe to ſhew him greater favor, if he perſevere as he hath
<pb facs="tcp:57308:73"/>
began. And you Daughter (ſaid he to the Princeſs <hi>Leono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>) what ſay you to this that my couſin <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> hath told you touching <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> that ſayeth he kéepeth the Caſtle <hi>the defended mountain</hi> for you onely? My Lord (ſaid ſhe) I know not how you and many others eſtéem ſo much of him, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſmall obedience he ſheweth to his father, for if he were ſuch a Knight as he is reported, he had long ſince come hither to acquit the promiſe whereunto he is bound: which maketh me verily think, the ſpéech <hi>Carmelle</hi> uſed of him, and all that he hath ſent you by word of mouth by my couſin <hi>Gaſtilles,</hi> are onely but diſſimulations. And I for my part am not yet determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (although he reporteth himſelf to be my knight) to accept him for the ſame, much leſs to pardon him before he comes in perſon to excuſe his fault, then I will conſider what I have to do. The Emperor that perceived his daughter ſpeak with ſuch a choler, &amp; therewith to bluſh more then ordinary, could not refrain laughter, and ſaid unto her: What daughter, do you refuſe the ſervice of the beſt Knight in all the world? I my Lord (ſaid ſhe) and ſo ſhould every maſter his ſervant, when he flyeth from his preſence, and obeyeth not his commandments no more then he hath done both yours and mine Truly ſwéet heart (ſaid the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror) I like you well, I would to God that nature had furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed you with a body like unto your heart, if ſhe had, ſhe had made you a perfect man, and not a woman as you are.

                  <p>How <hi>Frandalo</hi> accompanied of fourſcore Knights, iſſued out of <hi>Alfarin</hi> towards <hi>Teſifant,</hi> and of the taking of <hi>Eiraca</hi> Captain of the Town.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Knights of <hi>Great Britain</hi> arrived in the Town of <hi>Alfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi> (as you heard before) <hi>Frandalo</hi> and others that were
<pb facs="tcp:57308:73"/>
hurt being healed of their wounds, <hi>Belleris</hi> that ceaſed not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to hearken after <hi>Alphorax,</hi> was advertiſed by his ſpies, that he continued in the City of <hi>Teſifant,</hi> which he and <hi>Branfil</hi> told unto the reſt of their company, who therewith being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what incouraged, very earneſtly deſired <hi>Frandalo</hi> to lead them forth, and bring them to ſome place where they might lie in ambuſh to ſurpriſe <hi>Alphorax</hi> or ſome of his company if they chanced to ſtray abroad. <hi>Frandalo</hi> not willing to deny them any reaſonable requeſt, agréed (with the conſent of <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) to depart the next night following, and to take with them to the number of fourſcore Knights and no more, which <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> liked well, he minding to be one. Whereupon thoſe that were appointed for the journey prepared themſelves, and about Sun-ſetting iſſued out of <hi>Alfarin, Frandalo</hi> and <hi>Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> knowing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> country ſo well, that they néeded no other guides, but travelled ſtrait towards <hi>Teſifant,</hi> and having ridden till ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the clock at night, they came unto a croſs way, where <hi>Frandalo</hi> adviſed them to divide themſelves in two companies, willing the Knights (that before that time had never bin in <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky</hi>) to hold cloſe together. For (ſaid he) the wars in theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are far otherwiſe then they are in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> where Knights uſe moſt commonly to travel alone without compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and although they chance ſometimes to ride in companies, the leaſt occaſion that happeneth maketh them ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but here thoſe that uſe armes travel in great companies together, whereby the combates that are fought here moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are rather battels then incounters. And more then this, if thrée hundred <hi>Turks</hi> chance to ſurpriſe one hundred, thirty, twenty, or leſs number of their enemies, they take a pride to put them to death, preferring revenge before a certain kind of honor, that (as I have underſtood) is kept and obſerved in the Weſt parts, where combates are in a manner equal. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my friends (ſaid he) I pray you ſeperate not your your ſelves but march all in a company, aſſuring you that in the place whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we go, we ſhall not faile to finde men ſufficient againſt whom we may imploy our forces, and ſhew what valour is in us. I know that within half a mile of <hi>Teſifant Alpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:57308:74"/>
uſeth oftentimes to lie at a houſe that he hath cauſed to be made, called <hi>Gruobinach,</hi> where if it be our good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes we may chance to finde him, wherefore I am of adviſe that we divide our ſelves in two companies, my nephew <hi>Belleris</hi> ſhall take the left hand, and lie in ambuſh néer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the village of <hi>Jentinomele,</hi> from whence he may eaſily perceive when any man iſſueth out of <hi>Teſifant,</hi> and I with <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and the other half of our company will follow this way that bringeth us unto a valley néer to <hi>Gruobinach,</hi> where we will ſecretly ſtay if néed require, to ſuccor each other: where unto they all agréed: but before they departed thence, they found their enterpriſe to be far more dangerous than they eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it, as hereafter you ſhall hear. <hi>Belleris</hi> and his company leaving <hi>Frandalo,</hi> travelled ſo long, that about two hours before day they met ſix ſouldiers, whom <hi>Belleris</hi> ſaluted in the <hi>Arabian</hi> language, asking them of what place they were? My Lord, ſaid they, we are going to the town of <hi>Sraſſe.</hi> My good friends (ſaid he) we travel this night to <hi>Teſifant</hi> to advertiſe the prince <hi>Alphorax</hi> of the great dammage and deſtruction the Chriſtian dogs continually do, and within ſhort ſpace have done unto the country round about: for they are iſſued out of <hi>Alfarin,</hi> and have taken and carryed away all they can find: and as yet are abroad, not ceaſing to execute all tyranny they can deviſe: nevertheleſs, if it pleaſeth him to give us aid, we know the place of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, where we may eaſily incloſe them, &amp; not one of them ſhall eſcape. What are you, ſaid the Souldiers, that bring us theſe news? Friends (ſaid <hi>Belleris</hi>) I am <hi>Rouſſan,</hi> couſin to <hi>Eiraca,</hi> chief captain of <hi>Teſifant.</hi> We can tell you good news of him, ſaid the Souldiers wherewith we think you will be well pleaſed: for he is not far from hence, being ridden out of <hi>Teſifant</hi> with two hundred Knights to go unto <hi>Falandy,</hi> to ſée the ſame be not ſo lightly ſurpriſed as <hi>Alfarin</hi> was. But becauſe he willed us to ride before, we will ſtay no longer: wherewith they bad them farewel. Friends (ſaid <hi>Belleris</hi>) the good fortune I wiſh you I pray God may happen unto you. With that the ſouldiers paſſed on their way, but they had not gone far when <hi>Belleris</hi> ſent after them, and fearing they would diſcover his enterpriſe,
<pb facs="tcp:57308:74"/>
cauſed them to be ſlain: and therewith preſently diſpatched one of his Squires on meſſage to <hi>Frandalo,</hi> to advertiſe him of the enemies being abroad with a very ſtrong and huge company: whereupon he wiſhed him to joyn with them. The Squire made all the haſte he could, but before the news came to <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalo, Belleris</hi> met with <hi>Eiraca</hi> and his company about the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of <hi>Jentinomele,</hi> being upon them before they had time to put on their helmets. There did the Captain of <hi>Teſifant</hi> ſhew himſelf to be no yong beginner in arms, for that like a valiant and hardy knight he entred among the Chriſtians, and being ſeconded by his men, did moſt valiantly defend themſelves, and aſſailed the enemy, although at their firſt encounter ten of their braveſt ſoldiers were unhorſed and overthrown. And as <hi>Eiraca</hi> entered into the preaſe, <hi>Norandel</hi> and he met together with ſuch force, that <hi>Norandel</hi> was wounded in the left ſhoulder, but not ſore hurt, and the Captain of <hi>Teſifant</hi> looſing his ſtirrops, was thrown over his horſe with ſo great ſtrength, that with the fall he was forced to lie upon the ground, and could remove neither hand nor foot, which the Lurks perceiving, to relieve their Captain, did ſo valiantly, that they overthrew four of the Brittiſh Knights, who nevertheleſs roſe preſently again, and with their ſwords in hand, thruſt ſo many of the Turks horſes into the ſides and flancks, that in ſhort ſpace more than twenty of the Turks were overthrown likewiſe, and many ſlain out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: at that charge <hi>Enil</hi> and <hi>Gavarte</hi> were hurt, and the reſt ſo bardly handled, that without <hi>Frandalos</hi> company that came to ſuccor them, they had all béen overthrown: and in truth they had almoſt ſtrayed too long, but the ſquire that <hi>Belleris</hi> ſent unto them, could not overtake them before they were in the valley where they ſhould have met. And although they had heard the ſound of their blowes, yet did they not ſuſpect any ſuch peril, until the ſquire had done his meſſage; wherewith they ranne with all the ſpéed they could unto the place; where <hi>Belleris</hi> and his companions (being out of breath) did nothing but rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Frandalo, Eſplandian,</hi> and the reſt of their company, made them change opinion: for when they perceived their compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo hardly matched by the enemy, they entered among them with ſuch fury, that had it not béen for <hi>Eiraca</hi> (who at that time behaved himſelf moſt valiantly) they had overthrown the Turks at their firſt on-ſet, but by reaſon of the great reſiſtance he made, they continued fighting half an hour after, wherein he maintained himſelf ſo well, that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> could never take him before he had overthrown him, and pulled off his Helmet, wherewith he yielded: mean time <hi>Frandalo</hi> and his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being in the midſt of their enemies, laid ſo well about them, ſtaying horſes, pulling away ſhields, and doing ſo valiantly, that wonder it was to behold them, yet did not the Turks once ſéem abaſhed, but ſtill fought moſt couragiouſly, until ſuch time they perceived their Captain taken priſoner, which cauſed them to flie and turn their backs: but not all of them, for there lay more then one hundred and fifty of them dead upon the ground, the reſt ſaved themſelves by means of the dark night. It was then about an hour before day: and <hi>Frandalo</hi> fearing that thoſe of <hi>Teſifant</hi> (hearing of the overthrow) would iſſue forth to cut off their paſſage, preſently cauſed Captain <hi>Eiraca</hi> to be remoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and all the Chriſtians that wanted horſes, and with all ſpéed rode back again to <hi>Alfarin,</hi> not the ſame way they came, but another way, ſomewhat farther about; wherein they travelled ſo long, that about Sun-riſing they entred into a great wood, where they alighted to refreſh both themſelves and their horſes: and ſtaying not long there leſt they ſhould be ſurprized, they made ſuch ſpéed, that about ſun-ſetting they arrived in the town: mean time news came to <hi>Teſifant</hi> of the overthrow of their men, wherewith <hi>Alphorax</hi> was in ſuch a rage, that in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he ſéemed deſperate.

                  <p>Of the great grief <hi>Eſplandian</hi> had, underſtanding by the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> ſent unto him, what diſpleaſure the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine</hi> had conceived againſt him.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>YOu heard before how <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> ſhewed the Emperor what <hi>Eſplandian</hi> had done, and what meſſage he ſent unto him, and to the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine,</hi> as alſo what anſwer ſhe made, which <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> by his Squire writ and ſent unto him, having charge from the Emperor ſo to do, thereby to procure his ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier Arrival in <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The Squire with his Letter made ſuch haſte, that he arrived at <hi>Alfarin</hi> about five days after the taking of <hi>Eiraca,</hi> and méeting <hi>Carmelle</hi> at the gate, aſked her if he might find <hi>Eſplandian</hi> at convenient leiſure to deliver him a Letter from <hi>Gaſtilles,</hi> but <hi>Carmelle</hi> being ſubtil, ſuſpecting it to be ſome news from the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine,</hi> that might move <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> who as then ſéemed diſcontent, anſwered him &amp; ſaid: My good friend, you can hardly ſpeak with him at this time, but f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Squire did as ſhe willed him, and followed her to <hi>Eſplandians</hi> lodging: where entring into his chamber, ſhe found him ſitting on his bed tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with the king of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and delivered him <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> letter, which when he read, the tears ran out of his eyes, and therewith caſt forth a great ſigh, ſaying: O Lord? but <hi>Carmelle</hi> that beheld him, doubting the cauſe to be as ſhe ſuſpected, asked him if he were ill at eaſe. Ill? ſaid he, I that I am, and ſo ill that I would to God I were dead: and look I pray you, ſaid he, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have cauſe or not: wherewith ſtretching forth his hand, he gave <hi>Carmelle</hi> the letter, and turning his face, began to make the greateſt ſorrow in the world: but when ſhe had read the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, ſhe eſtéemed not thereof, but ſaid unto <hi>Eſplandian:</hi> What my Lord? are you abaſhed at ſo ſmall a matter? By my ſoul I now perceive very well, that the affections and loves of men are far different and much unlike the paſſions that we ſimple wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men endure, when we fall into the like extremities: and know
<pb facs="tcp:57308:76"/>
you how? you men do moſt commonly take pleaſure to manifeſt and make known your love either by word of mouth or outward ſhews, and many times diſſemble more than you mean to do: and which is worſe, how much the more the Lady or Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man you love is of great deſert, or high linage, ſo much more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry do you take to make it known, not onely that you bear her affection, but that you are beloved and favored of her above all others: which is clean contrary to the nature of women (I mean ſuch as may be tearmed wiſe and of good underſtanding) for how much the greater their parentage is, ſo much more fear they have to manifeſt their amorous paſsions, in ſuch manner, that moſt commonly hath in word, geſture, and countenance, they outwardly deny that which they have moſt deeply engraved in their hearts and mindes: and not without good cauſe, for that the thing which redoundeth to your praiſe and commendations (as you think, which is the manifeſting of your love) bréedeth to them a certain ſpot in their honor, which oftentimes they can not eaſily deface. Wherefore it is more than expedient, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this modeſty and conſtancy in us, not that I mean to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain my ſelf unto this law, ſéeing that all my glory and felicity dependeth upon you, in ſuch manner, that I deſire no greater happineſs in this world, then that the love and dutiful obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence I bear unto you, ſhould be publiſhed and made known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, to the end that all thoſe that ſhall hear of your great valor and my mean eſtate, may know my great good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, to have the mean to ſerve you as I do. Wherefore my lord, in my opinion you ought to take the ſpéeches <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> hath written unto you, to be uſed by the Lady <hi>Leonorine</hi> in good part and greatly to your advantage, for I dare warrant you on mine honor, that your affections are both alike: and to ſay the truth, ſhe hath behaved her ſelf moſt wiſely to diſſemble the matter ſo well as ſhe hath done in the Emperors preſence. I deny not but ſhe hath ſome cauſe to be impatient, conſidering the meſſage I delivered unto her in your behalf, but that is eaſie to be cured: and although the love ſhe hath born you ſo long time ſhould be wholly extinguiſhed (which I can hardly believe) even as a b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in that place than in any other part, ſo being there and in her company, ſhall win that you finde broken and by that means make it ſtronger than ever it was before. Therefore I am of advice (that fulfilling her deſire) you go unto her, and that as ſoon as poſſibly you may. Alas <hi>Carmelle</hi> (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) what good or what ſervice did I ever do unto her, thereby to have deſerved at her hands the leaſt favor among an infinite number I have received from her? Eſpecially by the report of your own mouth. If therefore ſhe hath juſt occaſion to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with me, having offended her ſo much, can I hope for any other at her hands than méer diſdain and mortal hatred? My Lord (ſaid <hi>Carmelle</hi>) I am a woman, and know the nature of women better than you do, or then all the men in the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I pray you therefore believe me, and go and ſée her, and if ſo be ſhe entertain you not according to your deſire, then never give credit to my words again. In faith my good companion (ſaid the King of <hi>Denmark) Carmelle</hi> giveth you ſo good and wiſe counſel, that either you ought to give credit to her ſpéech, or elſe wholly drive this fantaſie out of your minde, conſidering (as is moſt true) that ſometimes, and very often, how much the more fervent and extream the love of a woman is, ſo much the ſooner is it dead and wholly extinguiſhed, for that their incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy is ſuch and ſo great, that for the leaſt occaſion in the world they are over ready to love, and much more inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do they forget the ſame again: not that I accuſe the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine</hi> of ſo great lightneſs, but to ſay the truth as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly we finde, and for my part I know not upon what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion you ground your love, whereby you ſhould make ſo much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her, ſéeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe never ſaw you, nor you her, but are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly content to conceive well of each other upon a certain ronown that hath ſpred abroad, &amp; ſet forth the great perfections y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be in you both: which in truth may be compared to a fire made of ſtraw, that is no ſooner kindled but preſently conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: wherefore be not then ſo much abaſhed if the Princes <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norine</hi> ſhew her ſelf at this preſent ſo ſmally affected towards you, for thoſe that love moſt déerly, do oftentimes fall into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteſſes and coldneſs of affection, that they diſdain, or (at the
<pb facs="tcp:57308:77"/>
leaſt) in the twinkling of an eye, wholly forget thoſe that for a long time they have loved moſt intirely, and that for their ſakes ſhall have hazarded their lives in moſt dangerous adventures. Did you never hear how <hi>Briſarde</hi> behaved her ſelf in regard of <hi>Troilus,</hi> after the deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> ſhe loved him ſo well that ſhe would néeds die in his arms: when ſhe was conſtrained to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him, the Gréeks thinking verily ſhe would have ſlain her ſelf: and yet was ſhe ſcarſe iſſued out of <hi>Troy</hi> but ſhe wholly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got her love <hi>Troilus,</hi> and tranſported that vehement love ſhe had born him all her life, to <hi>Diomedes</hi> King of <hi>Thrace.</hi> O God? What inconſtancy? what lightneſs? what foundation upon a ſandy ground was that? This unconſtant woman among other precious ornaments given her by <hi>Troilus</hi> her friend, had a pair of perfumed gloves, which within one hour after her captivity ſhe gave unto her new friend <hi>Diomedes</hi> in token of the love and amity ſhe bare unto him. What had <hi>Troilus</hi> ſaid then if he had bin preſent? would he have believed her? I think not. And what a point of honeſty, I pray you, did <hi>Clitenineſtra</hi> ſhew unto her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, when in ſteed of welcoming him home at his coming from the ſiege of <hi>Troy,</hi> where he had remained ten years together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe cauſed him cruelly to be murdered by <hi>Egiſtus</hi> her ruffian. But will you hear more examples of the like matter? and as he began to procéed, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ſaid unto him, My good friend, I pray you do not this wrong unto my lady <hi>Leonorine,</hi> but let me here your counſel how I may from henceforth govern my ſelf to ſatisfie her deſire. Go and ſée her, ſaid the king, and if you think good, I will bear your company. Shall we go and leave our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions? (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) that will I never do: wherefore? ſaid the King: are not <hi>Frandalo, Manley,</hi> and the reſt of their company ſtrong enough to defend the town in your abſence? I am of adviſe that you ſend preſently for them, &amp; give them to underſtand that by reaſon of certain news you have of late received, you muſt be conſtrained to leave them for the ſpace of eight or fiftéen days: and in like ſort diſpatch <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> ſquire, and write unto his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that you thank him heartily for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good remembrance he hath had of you, and that with all ſpéed you will ſend a meſſenger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly unto the Emperor with an anſwer to that it hath pleaſed

Next day in the morning <hi>Frandalo</hi> and the reſt of the company came into his chamber as they uſed ordinarily to do, and being together deviſing of divers things, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ſaid unto them: My good friends, I am conſtrained to leave your company for the ſpace of fiftéen days or thrée wéeks, to go about certain urgent affairs that import me much: I will take with me my brother the King of <hi>Denmark, Gandalin, Enil, Carmelle,</hi> and no more. I pray you think it not ſtrange, for if I were not conſtrained thereunto, I ſwear unto you of my faith, I would not do it. There was not any among them that once would ask him whither he went, but anſwering him, ſaid: That he might go whither it pleaſed him, and that they for their parts would kéep the place till he came again, although he ſtaid a whole year before he returned: by this means <hi>Eſplandian</hi> by little and little framed himſelf to take his voyage. while the king of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> cauſed the ſhip that brought the knights of <hi>Great Britain</hi> thither, to be made ready, and upon a munday in the morning <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandian</hi> and his company imbarqued themſelves to ſayl unto the caſtle <hi>the defended mountain,</hi> but they were no ſooner put to ſea, but the wind falling contrary, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sea roſe ſo high and ſo furious withal, that neither maſt, ſail, nor cord could hold, but brake all in pieces: in which manner they continued for the ſpace of ten days, and as many nights, ſo that neither maſter nor marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners could tell in what part they were, for that during that time, the clouds were ſo thick and the miſt ſo great, that it made the air ſo dark and obſcure, that thoſe that were in the Ship, could ſcarce ſée one the other, expecting nothing elſe

                  <p>How <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and his company went up unto the broken pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of the Enchantereſs, and of the ſtrange things they found there.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>ESplandian</hi> and his company being on land, not knowing the place where they were arrived, cauſed a great fire to be made, about the which they thought to lie down and ſléep, but they heard ſuch a noiſe from the top of the Rock, that they were all abaſhed: with that the winde began to ceaſe, and the Sea to wax calm, the sky ſhewing full of Stars, and withal the Moon ſhone ſo bright, that it ſéemed as light as if it had bin day; wherefore <hi>Eſplandian</hi> deſirous to know what the noiſe might be, determined to mount up the Rock, but he was counſelled by his company to ſtay till the next day in the morning. When <hi>Eſplandian</hi> knew it certainly to be the Rock of the Enchantreſs, he ſaid unto the King of <hi>Denmark:</hi> I good truth I think I have béen here before, and take it to be the place whither the great Serpent brought me the ſame day I received the order of Knighthood, which putteth me in better hope of our voyage then I had before: which he ſaid, remembring the ſcroll with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie that he found in the lions paw. Then he told the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> how he conquered the Sword he bare, the death of the Serpent, and all that he had ſéen upon the Rock, and it is called (ſaid he) the Rock of the Enchantreſs. By God (ſaid <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin</hi>) you ſay true, for I remember, that purſuing after a knight that led a Gentlewoman away, I found your father king <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> and <hi>Grandaſor</hi> here, and the knight likewiſe that I ſought that had hidden himſelf in the old pallace upon this Rock: then he told them from point to point what had happened unto him, and the great love the knight bare unto the gentlewoman he had carried away by force, but (ſaid he) before we departed ſhe

agréed with him, and they promiſed marriage to each other, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though before that time ſhe hated him moſt deadly: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, underſtanding that the force he uſed unto her was onely done for the love he bare her, ſhe clean forgot her former hatred, changing it to a moſt excéeding love. In good faith (ſaid <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melle</hi>) as far as I perceive, no man ought to deſpair of any thing he taketh in hand, no more will I during my life: which ſhe ſaid in reſpect of <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> who in time as ſhe thought might love her, and wholly forget the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine.</hi> And ſo long they talked, that day began to appear, then <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ſaid to the King of <hi>Denmark:</hi> Companion, I pray you ſtay here or me while I go up, for I will have no body with me but <hi>Gandalin</hi> and <hi>Enil,</hi> and they ſhall go with me, not that I fear any danger that may happen unto me, but onely becauſe they may help me to lift up the tomb whereof I told you even now. My Lord (ſaid the King) I pray you offer me not ſo much injury, for I will not leave you though it coſt me my life, eſpecially in this place where I have moſt great deſire to ſée that I never ſaw before.

                     <hi>Jupiter</hi> is great God of all Gods, and in his right hand he bare a Table containing this propheſie, When time ſhall come, that my art and knowledge ſhall faile, the heart of the hand incloſed herein, and life reſtored by them that were the cauſe of death, the Grecian ſheep long time nouriſhed in pleaſant paſtures, ſhall be conſtrained to feed on a herb bitterer then Gaul, by meanes of the extremity the hungry Sea-Wolves ſhall put them unto, whoſe number ſhall be ſo great, that they ſhall cover the Sea in divers places, in ſuch wiſe, that the poor ſheep incloſed in their great Forreſt, and divers of their lambs being dead and torn in pieces, their ſhepheard (having in a manner loſt all hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring them again,) with anguiſh of heart and mind, in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of tears ſhall lament their great misfortune. Then ſhall come the brave Lions whelp, by whoſe means the great troop of wolves ſhall be driven away and deſtroyed. Nevertheleſs, he

ſhall take from the ſhepheard his great power, and the beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of his ſheep, whereupon he ſhall ſeize, in ſuch ſort, that his ſtrong teeth and ſharp clawes ſhall enter into her heart, and the entrailes of her body, the reſt of the flock reſting in the power and government of him and his fierce company, whereby not long after it ſhall come to paſs, that the great deceitful Serpent, the Inchanted Sword, and this high Rock, ſhall ſink into the bottom of the Sea, and ſhall never after be ſeen again of any man.</p>
               </q>
               <p>But although <hi>Eſplandian</hi> underſtood the Gréek tongue, yet could he not give any interpretation or expoſition to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, no more could any of his company: wherefore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, not to ſtay long about the ſame, but were more buſied to behold the ſtones and great riches they ſaw within the tomb, which they determined to take with them, and return unto their ſhips without ſtaying any longer, for their victuals began to fail: wherefore <hi>Eſplandian</hi> willed <hi>Carmelle</hi> to take the Lion, he and the king of <hi>Denmark</hi> took the plate of Chriſtal, <hi>Gandalin</hi> and <hi>Enil</hi> the azure ſtone, and the Squires the Ceder Cheſt with the Image of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> And in that ſort they iſſued out of the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, deſcending down the rock, till about evening they came unto the hermitage, where they ſtayed all night: the next day they went on till they found their ſhip, wherein about Sunſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting they imbarqued themſelves: and becauſe <hi>Eſplandian</hi> would not be ſéen in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> without the great Serpent, he commanded the maſter of the Ship to direct his courſe to the caſtle called <hi>the defended mountain,</hi> whith he did. But having ſailed about two days and more, as the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſat talking with <hi>Eſplandian</hi> about the Letter that was ſent unto him, he asked him if he thought not good that he ſhould make a voyage unto the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine</hi> to underſtand the truth of her affection towards him.

But the next night following there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſuch a tempeſt, that at the break of day their Pilot knew not where he was, and without knowledge of the place he was conſtrained to abandon the Pinnace unto the mercy of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, which continued for the ſpace of forty days together, in which time they indured ſo many fortunes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it would be over-te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to recount them, and we ſhould likewiſe digreſs from the matter whereunto we are entered, to bring our Hiſtory unto an end. Let it therefore ſuffice you to know, that their victuals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpent, they chanced to arrive in the Iſland of the Giant <hi>Drapheon,</hi> where the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and his ſquire loſt their wits and became mad, by force of a water that they drunk out of a fountain called <hi>the fountain of Forgetfulneſs,</hi> that ſprang in that Iſle, where they were taken and kept in a cruel priſon, from whence in ſhort time after they were delivered by the meanes of a Gentlewoman that fell in love with the King, and cauſed him to recover his health, armes, horſe, and a ſhip, with all things neceſſary for himſelf and his Squire, and having done, ſhe with them put to Sea: and coaſting the country of <hi>Treviſane,</hi> they came unto an Iſland where the people of the countrey would have burnt a Gentlewoman becauſe ſhe could not finde a Knight for to maintain her quarrel: but the King fought for her, and overcame him that accuſed her, and taking the Gentlewoman with him, put to Sea again, and ſailing ſix days together along the coaſt, he perceived a maid out of a tower, wherein the Lord of that countrey kept her priſoner, for the cauſe which ſhe declared to the King out of a window that
<pb facs="tcp:57308:80"/>
looked into the Sea, for whoſe ſake the king took land to fight with the Lord till he delivered the poor Gentlewoman out of priſon: ſuch were the adventures of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> which are rehearſed at large in the great Chronicles, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> wrote not long after the Coronation of <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian:</hi> wherein the proweſs and adventures of the Brittiſh Knights and others remaining at <hi>Alfarin,</hi> are likewiſe regiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and orderly ſet down.

               </argument>
               <p>AFter that <hi>Garinter</hi> King of <hi>Denmark</hi> had ſet ſaile towards <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> as it is ſaid before, <hi>Eſplandians</hi> ſhip arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the gulf where he promiſed to ſtay, &amp; they lay at anker for the ſpace of two wéekes, not hearing any news of his deſired meſſage: wherewith he doubted either that the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> ſhould be drowned, or that forturne had carried his veſſel ſome other way: wherefore he thought to ſend one of his marriners to enquire of him. But before he did it, he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned firſt to ſpeak with <hi>Carmelle,</hi> and taking her aſide, ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her: My great friend, you know for what cauſe the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> left us, and the reaſon of his voyage, as alſo the promiſe he made unto me to return again with all ſpéed, but we can hear no news of him at all, which maketh me aſſuredly believe either he is dead, or that the ſtorm he was in hath caſt
<pb facs="tcp:57308:81"/>
him in ſome countrey ſo far off, that he cannot by any means do as he hath promiſed, wherefore I pray you give me your advice what I were beſt to do: for thoſe that are in the like mind that I am, although in ſome things they have their underſtandings whole and perfect, yet are they commonly to ſéek in that which concerneth them as touching thoſe points. My lord (ſaid ſhe) ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is your pleaſure to uſe my counſel, I wil tel you truly what I think therein, and ſo much I can aſſure you, that if you ſhould ſearch throughout the world, you ſhall hardly find one that can come néer me in judging the paſsion wherewith you are mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted: for the ſame is in me that is in you, and I féel it as well as you do, and it may be more, but the eaſe and great contentment I receive by your preſence, hath given me ſo many remedies, that I delight in my grief, and live not, but only to cauſe my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to indure To tell you truth, at ſuch time as you began to uſe ſpéeches unto me of the king of <hi>Denmark,</hi> I thought upon his long abſence, and me thinketh it were beſt we ſailed unto <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> aſſuring you that I have deviſed a means to bring you unto the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine,</hi> whereby you may both ſée and ſpeak with her, without being known of any other then her ſelf, if you think it good. And to bring it to paſs, (we being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there) it ſhall be neceſſary that all thoſe of our ſhip be adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed (if any man asketh for you) to ſay, that you ſtayed in the caſtle <hi>the defended mountain,</hi> mean time you ſhall lie in the bottom of the ſhip, and I with <hi>Gandalin</hi> and <hi>Enil,</hi> will go unto the Emperor, to whom I will ſay that you ſent me to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Leonorine,</hi> to preſent unto her in your behalf, that which you have conquered in the Rock of the Enchantreſs, and for the reſt let me alone. When <hi>Eſplandian</hi> heard her ſpeak in that manner, he beheld her for a while, and at laſt ſaid unto her: My good friend, I fear not death, neither can it be more bitter or ſharper unto me then the life I now indure: but I fear the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor of my Lady, and the injury that thereby I might do unto the Emperor, who by his courteſie hath ſo much bound my father unto him, as if I ſhould wrong him, it would be a blemiſh to my honor while I live. Nevertheleſs, I am content to hazard my ſelf in all the dangers you ſhall think convenient: that is ſufifci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb facs="tcp:57308:81"/>
(ſaid <hi>Carmelle</hi>) I pray you then be merry and make good chear: for if ever woman accompliſhed the thing ſhe took in hand I will bring this to paſs. Wherewith leaving <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> ſhe called the Patron, and willed him to ſet ſayl for <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whereunto he obeyed, and had ſo good a winde, that within thrée days after they entered into the haven: where being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> told his men what (by the counſel of <hi>Carmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi>) he had determined to do, commanding them expreſly not to make it known to any man of his being there, but that they ſhould ſay they left him in the caſtle <hi>the defended mountain.</hi> For (ſaid he) I am not now in ſuch eſtate as I would be to preſent my ſelf before ſo great a Prince as the Emperor is. And to the end you be not found liars, I will ſtay in the bottom of the ſhip till you return again: then he, <hi>Carmelle, Gandalin,</hi> and <hi>Enil</hi> ſpake together, where the gentlewoman ſhewed them at large how ſhe meant to bring her enterpriſe to paſs, I will preſently (ſaid ſhe) cauſe the tomb we brought from the Rock of the Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs to be ſet up in the ſame ſort we found it, upon the hatches of the ſhip, then will I go tell the Emperor that I have one of the ſingulareſt things abord that ſhip that ever was ſéen, and we finde means to bring him hither, where I will ſhew him the Lion with <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and all the reſt of the furniture, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſéen and peruſed, I will tell him that you ſend it to the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine,</hi> He being gone unto his palace, you ſhall go into the Cedar Cheſt, and ſo will I cauſe you to be carryed into the princeſs chamber lying in the ſame, whereof I will ſecretly advertiſe her, and by this means ſhe may ſpeak to you, and you to her what you think good.

the gentlewoman prepared the tomb as ſhe had determined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: with that ſhe, <hi>Gandalin,</hi> and <hi>Enil,</hi> landed and went unto the Emperor, whom they ſaluted moſt honorably, but <hi>Carmelle</hi> did him no reverence: for (as it is ſaid before) ſhe eſtéemed not of any man living, how great a Prince ſoever he were, but only of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandian:</hi> ſhe and <hi>Gandalin</hi> were known in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> by reaſon of their being there before. Wherefore the Emperor received <hi>Gandalin</hi> very courteouſly, and with ſmiling counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſaid unto him: Friend <hi>Gandalin,</hi> although your preſents hath procured great melancholly in my minde, remembring I have often ſéen you here with the man, that in all Chriſtendom I moſt entirely love, whom I am utterly perſwaded I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſée again, yet you are heartily welcome, and I pray you tell me how doth the knight with the Gréen Sword.

miſfortunes and hard adventures that ſhe her ſelf had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him: and vertue, for that in the end of his days ſhe hath ſet him in the way to enter into paradiſe. And leaving that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: he changed purpoſe and ſpake to <hi>Carmelle,</hi> of whom in jeſt he asked, if ſhe were ſtill tormented with the extream paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of love towards <hi>Eſplandian</hi> as ſhe had béen in times paſt.

Whereat eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man began to laugh. In good faith (ſaid the Emperor) we may then very wel perſwade our ſelves, that you came not to our Court to move any of our Gentlewomen to love the good knight your maſter, although he ſhould expreſly command you to do it. My Lord (ſaid ſhe) you judge as in reaſon it ought to be, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs I take ſo great a pleaſure in ſerving him to his content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that I will except no ſervice whatſoever: and to ſpeak truth, my arrival here is to ask your Grace a gift, neither gold nor ſilver, but onely that it would pleaſe you to go unto the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to ſée a preſent that my Lord <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ſendeth to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Leonorine</hi> as her knight. In good truth (ſaid the Emperor) you require a thing at our hands, that we ſhould rather deſire at yours. Come then my Lord (ſaid ſhe) for I may not ſtay long here. With that the Emperor (accompanied of divers Noble men) went unto the haven, and being there, entred into <hi>Carmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> ſhip, ſhe ſhewed him the chriſtal tomb, then that of azure ſtone, and laſtly the Image of <hi>Jupiter:</hi> whereat the Emperor ſtayed longer to behold it than the reſt, not ſo much for the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof, as to read the prophecy it held: and having read it, was not a little abaſhed: which <hi>Carmelle</hi> perceiving, ſpake unto him and ſaid: My Lord, all this you ſée hath continued above two hundred years in the broken palace of the inchantreſs, yet in all that time not any knight (how valiant ſoever he were) could ever conquer the ſame, nor yet ſo much as ſée it, until my lord <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> arrived there, that is become Lord and poſſeſſor of the ſame, as you now behold. Truly (ſaid the Emperor) it is the goodlieſt preſent that ever I ſaw, and worthy the greateſt admiration: for although it be of incomparable riches, yet do I eſtéem it of no

value in reſpect of the great ſcience and wonderful knowledge that was in her to whom it firſt belonged, as ſhe maketh it well appear by the threatnings ſhe uſed againſt us in this table: God grant all may fall out better than I doubt it will. My Lord (ſaid <hi>Carmelle</hi>) although it be ſuch as you eſtéem it, yet do I fear that my Lady your Daughter will not make ſo much account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that in recompence of the ſame ſhe will acquit the good knight <hi>Amadis</hi> and the maſter that I ſerve, of the promiſe they have made unto her. I know not that (ſaid the Emperor) but I am well aſſured, that no earthly treaſure can be comparable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the valor and vertue of your maſter: neither will I ever give my conſent that <hi>Leonorine</hi> ſhall make that exchange, as deſiring the company of <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> much more than to have all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in the world within my coffers: and with good reaſon, for that the wickedeſt perſon living on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth may be rich of gold and ſilver, but not of vertue, which is not abundant unto any but to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

My Lord (ſaid <hi>Carmelle</hi>) I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to leave them with the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine,</hi> whether it be upon that condition or not: and if it be your pleaſure (ſéeing ſhe is not come hither with you) I will cauſe it to be carryed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her chamber.

Wherewith he departed out of the ſhip, and being a land walked to wards his pallace, not without much talk with his knights and noble men, touching the excellency of the tomb.

               </argument>
               <p>THe Emperor and his company gone as it is ſaid before, <hi>Carmelle</hi> called <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> that in the mean time lay in the bottom of the Ship, and told him the manner of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedings, as alſo the ſpéech the Emperor had with <hi>Gandalin</hi> and <hi>Enil,</hi> and all what had happened, as it is before rehearſed By my ſoul (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) I was never in the like pain, for hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all you ſpeak, onely the Lady <hi>Leonorine,</hi> I could not tell what to think: but when the Emperor told you ſhe was not in the City, believe me, it comforted my heart. Did not I play my part well? ſaid <hi>Carmelle.</hi> That you did, and as well as one could wiſh, (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) and if it be true which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid: That a good beginning makes a good ending, I hope I ſhall not fail to bring my purpoſe to paſs. And while they deviſed together it waxed night, ſo that the Empreſs returned into the City: which <hi>Carmelle</hi> underſtanding, cauſed <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> preſently to lie down in the Cedar Cheſt, in ſuch ſort, that the air entred therein on all ſides, and covering it with the Azure and Chriſtal Stones, <hi>Gandalin, Enil,</hi> and their Squires took the tomb, and with the Gentlewoman went out of the ſhip and came unto the pallace, where they found the Lady <hi>Leono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> (being already advertiſed of the goodly Preſent ſent her by <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) in great devotion ſtaying for <hi>Carmelle,</hi> for it had béen told her, that in the evening ſhe would bring it to her lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging: wherefore ſhe had no ſooner eſpyed it, but ſhe (with many other Ladies and gentlewomen no leſs curious to behold y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame) met her in the hall. With that <hi>Carmelle</hi> (perceiving her come) ſtepped forwards, and doing reverence unto her, ſaid: Madam, the good knight <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ſendeth you this Preſent, that not long ſince he conquered in the Rock of the Enchantreſs, according to the good fortune and happy deſtiny above hundred years paſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated of him: which he ſendeth unto you, expreſly to give
<pb facs="tcp:57308:84"/>
you to underſtand the great deſire that daily more and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in him to be your faithful Knight. But before you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céed further, it is convenient you grant me two requeſts: the one, that neither you nor any other ſhall look into the tomb until the morning that I return again with the key to open a Cedar cheſt, that you ſhall finde therein: the other, that after you have ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it you ſhall give it me, to carry with me to the place, where my father kéepeth his hermitage, therein to bury the bones of <hi>Matroco</hi> that died a Chriſtian, as you have underſtood. <hi>Carmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi> my friend (ſaid the Princeſs) that am I content to do: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs I am much abaſhed why <hi>Eſplandian</hi> deferreth the time ſo long before he cometh to ſée the Emperor. Madam (ſaid ſhe) I will tell you that to morrow: mean time, I pray you, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine where you will have our men to ſet down their charge. In the Great Hall (ſaid <hi>Leonorine</hi>) that my Gentlewomen may ſée it at their eaſe. In faith Madam, you ſhall pardon me (ſaid <hi>Carmelle:</hi>) this place is too open and over common to leave ſo precious a thing ſtanding therein: I deny not to let them have the pleaſure to behold it, but having ſéen it, for the more ſafety it ſhall be ſet into your own chamber, whereof you and none other ſhall have the key. With that they that bare the tomb, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the hall and ſet it down, till <hi>Leonorine</hi> and the reſt of the Gentlewomen had beheld it long: and if <hi>Carmelle</hi> had not béen there, aſſure your ſelves it had béen better viſited than it was: but ſhe would not depart from thence till it was ſhut up. Which done, taking her leave, as ſhe went out ſhe took the Princeſs aſide, and giving her the key of the Cheſt wherein <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandian</hi> lay, ſaid unto her: Madam, I leave you in this tomb two ineſtimable treaſures, although their difference be great, as you may well perceive you being alone: for it is ſure, that under this key lyeth the thing, that in all the world you moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee: and without ſtaying <hi>Leonorines</hi> anſwer, ſhe went out of the chamber, and with <hi>Gandalin</hi> and his company returned to the ſhip, leaving the Princeſs in a marvellous doubt by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the words ſhe uſed unto her: &amp; therewith did ſo certainly perſwade her ſelf, that her friend <hi>Eſplandian</hi> lay dead within the ſame, that ſhe was conſtrained to cauſe all her gentlewomen to

In good faith then (ſaid the Quéen) you ſhall do me wrong, and I ſhall have good cauſe to think the love and favor that in times paſt you have ſhewen unto me, to be altogether fained: whereat I am much grieved, ſéeing I have born ſuch a mind to you, that I would never have failed to hazard not only my honor but my life and ſoul both for your ſake: when the Princeſs heard her ſpake with ſuch affection, ſhe was ſomewhat better aſſured, and thereupon ſaid unto her: Séeing you are ſo deſirous to know the cauſe, you ſhall hear it preſently, upon condition you ſhall promiſe me to be a means rather to hinder my days than any ways to further them ſéeing I am fully determined to die. You may yet well remember (ſaid ſhe) the firſt time y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Carmelle</hi> came hither to bring us news of <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> ſon to the good Knight with the gréen Sword, that had commandment from his father (as ſhe ſaid) to come hither to ſerve us in his place, according to the promiſe he had made unto us being in this court: &amp; <hi>Carmelle</hi> ſaid, that for that cauſe onely <hi>Eſplandian</hi> had ſent her unto <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> to give the Emperor and us to underſtand thereof: but there were other matters in the wind, for ſhe came expreſly to intreat me to be good unto her maſter, who for the great love and affection be bare unto me, lived in the greateſt pain that p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible could be. Whereupon it happened, that being vanquiſhed and overcome with an infinite number of reaſons that ſhe
<pb facs="tcp:57308:85"/>
made unto me, I confirmed in my heart, that which his renown had already imprinted in my mind; and therewith determined for to wiſh more good to him than to my ſelf: not that I ever thought to commit any fault that might redound to my diſhonor, but onely for the glory to have ſo worthy a knight ready at my commandement: whereby this fire did ſo augment in me, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince I would not think on any other thing than upon <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandian,</hi> with whoſe love my mind hath béen ſo moved, that his long abſence hath almoſt procured my death: yet the hope I had from day to day to ſée him, hath made me able to ſuſtain my grief with ſo great patience, that neither you nor any other, as I think, could ever perceive it in me. But as the Sailor on the Sea being in a tempeſt, thinking at length to arrive at ſome haven for to ſave himſelf, ſuddenly méeteth with a Rock that breaketh his ſhip in pieces: ſo I (moſt unfortunate Lady) ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping by the preſence of him I ſo much deſire to ſée, to be at the end of my great ſorrow, am now fallen into the gulf of deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, conſidering the ſpéech which <hi>Carmelle</hi> uſed to me, who ſpeaking ſoftly, ſaid in this manner: Madam, I leave you within this tomb two ineſtimable treaſures: the one is the thing that in all the world you moſt deſire to ſée: which maketh me verily think it can be no other thing than the dead body of <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> and that (as it is very likely) he hath deſired at his death to be brought unto me to wéep and lament over him, as I mean to do during the term of my life: which if it pleaſeth God ſhall not be very long. And ſaying ſo ſhe caſt forth a great ſigh, ſwooning in Quéen <hi>Minoreſſes</hi> arms: who being abaſhed to hear the Princeſs uſe thoſe words ſo far from the eſtimation ſhe always had conceived of her, knew not at the firſt what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of comfort to miniſter unto her: nevertheleſs conſidering the extremity ſhe was in, minding to provide for two accidents that both at one inſtant preſented themſelves, ſhe ran in all haſte to fetch cold water, which throwing in her face, ſhe revived again. Wherewith the Quéen ſaid unto her, What Madam? will you throw the helve after the hatcher? Will you be holden for a fool, and looſe the reputation that is ſpread of you throughout y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world? Where is the conſtancy, the modeſty, and the wiſdom where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb facs="tcp:57308:85"/>
you were wont to be adorned? Muſt you for one word (which you miſunderſtand) forget your ſelf ſo much? Suppoſe it were true that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ſhould be dead, can you call him again by this tormenting your ſelf? For Gods ſake be patient, and if the worſt be, you may prove if it be ſo and not fall into this kind of fantaſie upon your own imaginations: <hi>Carmelle</hi> hath told you that the thing you moſt deſire in all the world is incloſed in this tomb: is it therefore to be ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ſhould not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live? Think you he is the firſt man that hath done the like for his beloveds ſake? This I aſſure you, that although I break the tomb and all that belongeth to it, I will preſently ſée what may be in it. Alas couſin (ſaid the Princeſs) I fear you will ſée it over ſoon for me, for if he be dead (as I think he is) aſſure your ſelf I will bear him company before it be day. I pray you (ſaid the quéen) be not unhappy before your time, but let me work the feat: hold then (ſaid <hi>Leonorine</hi>) here is the key that <hi>Carmelle</hi> left me: which the Quéen took in her hand, and entring into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber where the tomb ſtood, ſhe lifted up the Chriſtal plate; that done, ſhe ſpake aloud, and asked if any body were within the ſame: <hi>Eſplandian</hi> (to whom one hour ſéemed a whole year) ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for that time, and hearing the Quéen ſpeak, anſwered pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, and ſaid: I Madam. Who are you? (ſaid <hi>Minoreſſe.</hi>) Madam, ſaid he, I am the happy or unahppy knight <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> that put my ſelf into this tomb, ready to receive either death or life, as it ſhall pleaſe the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine</hi> to diſpoſe. Are you (ſaid the Quéen) <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> ſon to the good knight with the Gréen Sword, that by meſſages hath ſo oftentimes promiſed to come and ſerve us? I Madam (ſaid he) and that to accompliſh my word, have cauſed my ſelf to be brought hither in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. If you will promiſe me (ſaid the Quéen) and ſwear not to paſs my commandment in that I ſhall appoint you to do, I will cauſe you both to ſée and ſpeak to her you deſire ſo much to ſerve? That will I promiſe you, (ſaid he) and a greater matter like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſo my Lady be content. It is enough (ſaid the Quéen) wherewith ſhe lifted up the ſecond plate, and then opened the Cheſt wherein he lay, and coming out, he uſed great reverence to the Quéen, but as then he knew her not, till ſhe ſaid unto him:
<pb facs="tcp:57308:86"/>
Sir Knight, it may be you have heard of me before this time, I am <hi>Minoreſſe,</hi> that to deliver my Lady and you from the great pain you both endure, hath taken you out of this your priſon: Wherefore I pray you ſtay here a while, till I return again. With that ſhe went unto the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine</hi> (that mean time for fear ſhook like an Aſpen leaf) and with a merry countenance ſaid unto her: Madam, when we have a long and hard Winter, it is commonly ſéen there followeth a pleaſant Summer: and after great ſorrow cometh excéeding joy. You have bewailed your Knight <hi>Eſplandian</hi> for dead, but never in all my life have I ſéen a dead creature buried that was ſo fair, and of ſo pleaſant countenance, as the dead man I have found within the Tomb: I pray you come and ſée if I be deceived or not. When the Princeſs heard the Queen uſe thoſe words touching <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> and to laugh withal with joy, her heart leaped in her body, and riſing out of her bed, without ſpeaking any word, ſhe ran preſently into the Chamber, at the entery whereof ſhe eſpied him ſhe had ſo much lamented: who preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kneeled down to kiſs her hands. But <hi>Leonorine</hi> was not as then diſpoſed to uſe Ceremonies, but forgetting her accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed modeſty, and the gravity required in her Sex, eſpecially the ſhamefac'dneſs that commonly is ſeen to be in wiſe and vertuous Ladies, could not ſo much command her own affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but caſt her ſelf into <hi>Eſplandian's</hi> arms, kiſſing him with ſo great affection, as if ſhe had ſéen, loved and known him all her life time. And aſſure your ſelf, if Queen <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> had not drawn her back, and reproved her lightneſs, that at that inſtant thoſe two Lovers had died in the place, for that both their ſpirits had abandoned all their viral parts to meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at their mouthes, and to embrace each other, even to the extreamity of their lips, ready to paſs further. I ſay not but that Queen <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> did them wrong: and likewiſe, if any man would accuſe <hi>Leonorine</hi> of folly or inconſtancy, I anſwer him again, that ſhe is moſt eaſily to be excuſed both of the one and the other, for although ſhe never had ſéen <hi>Eſpladian</hi> before that time, and that in reaſon ſhe ſhould have known him better before ſhe ſhewed her ſelf ſo private unto him, you muſt ſuppoſe
<pb facs="tcp:57308:86"/>
(as it is true) that love had of long time before ſo well ingraven him in her minde, that ſhe ceaſed not to ſée him every day with her inward eyes. And as Nature had ſtudied to make her moſt perfect in all perfections whatſoever, love had likewiſe taken pleaſure to make her the beſt beloved and the trueſt lover that ever was before her time. Wherefore it is not to be marvelled, if at the firſt ſhe ſhewed ſo good a countenance to her friend, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the pain and grief ſhe had endured ſince the time <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melle</hi> brought her news. Theſe two lovers being thus before each other (<hi>Eſplandian</hi> ſtill knéeling ſéemed to be raviſh'd, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> quéen <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> could not refrain to ſay to <hi>Leonorine:</hi> Madam, me thinks you ſhould do well to command the Knight to riſe up, and lead him into your chamber, where you may talk together while the night endureth, if you think good: but to let him knéel ſtill on the ground, in good faith it is not well. My good friend (ſaid <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norine</hi>) he hath fled from us for almoſt two years together, now I mean to kéep him ſo néer me, that ſhe ſhall not eaſily eſcape a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: with that ſhe took him by the hand to lift him up, but he would not ſtir, but ſaid unto her: Madam, <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> not long ſince ſent me word being at <hi>Alfarin,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you were much offended with me, I pray you ſhew me the cauſe: for if ever I committed fault againſt you, it hath bin onely in loving you with all my heart, as I am bound to do Nevertheleſs, if in your adviſe I ſéem to have preſumed over-much, pardon me I pray you, and give me what puniſhment you ſhall think good. My friend (ſaid ſhe) your abſence hath procured me ſo great cauſe of grief, that I both pray you, and command you, from henceforth not to abſent your ſelf from me long again. Madam (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) having (with your leave) made another voyage to my companions, that may think ill of me, leaving them in their chiefeſt néed, to come hither for my pleaſure: I ſwear unto you of my faith I will never offend you more in that manner, or any other way whatſoever. I am content to grant you that (ſaid ſhe) ſo you return as ſoon as poſsible you may: And for the reſt I will that from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth you love me in ſuch ſort, that not any other but my ſelf ſhall have power over you, and that you be my Knight: Now I pray you ſtand up, and I will ſhew you further of
<pb facs="tcp:57308:87"/>
my mind. With that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> roſe up, and <hi>Leonorine</hi> taking him by the right hand, led him into her chamber, where ſhe ſet him a chair, and ſhe ſat by him, there they began to ſhew the pains each of them had indured, in what manner their love did firſt begin, who was the mean thereof, and the end whereunto they pretended, which was their future marriage. In which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, they grew into ſuch alterations, that if quéen <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> had not béen there as witneſs to their talk, conſidering the heat they then were in, I think not, but in time they would have eaſily procéeded to a further matter. In that manner the two lovers paſſed the night till day began to appear: which Quéen <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> perceiving, went to <hi>Leonorine,</hi> and ſaid unto her: Madam, the ſecreteſt follies are always beſt, it is almoſt day, and it may be the Empreſs may ſend ſome one of her women, or come her ſelf in perſon to viſit you, for that yeſternight very late it was told her you were not well. I pray you give this knight leave to depart, and let us ſhut him in the Cheſt, as we found him at the firſt. Alas how hard were thoſe words unto <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> and no leſs unto the Princeſs, who foreſéeing the danger that might fall out if they were ſound together, ſaid unto him: My good friend, this happy night that hath favored us ſo much, ſhall cauſe you if you think good, to remember the promiſe you have made unto me: I pray you let me ſée you again as ſoon as poſsibly you may. And as ſhe ended thoſe words, the Quéen that ſtood as a ſtout watch, heard ſome body come up the ſtairs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with being in great fear, ſhe told the Princeſs <hi>Lenorine,</hi> which made <hi>Eſplandian</hi> preſently go into the other chamber, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having time to take any longer farewel, laid himſelf down into the Cedar Cheſt, yet <hi>Leonorine</hi> could not abſtain, but muſt of force kiſs him before he was ſhut in, and as they laid the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal Plate upon the tomb, <hi>Carmelle</hi> knocked at the door, and with her <hi>Gandalin</hi> and <hi>Enil,</hi> and the reſt of the company that the night before had brought him thither. With that Quéen <hi>Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe</hi> opened the door, and they entering in the chamber, <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melle</hi> ſaw <hi>Leonorine</hi> that came unto her, to whom after ſhe had done her reverence, ſhe ſaid: Madam, I am commanded by him that ſent me unto you, not to ſtay any longer here, is it not
<pb facs="tcp:57308:87"/>
your pleaſure to give me leave to depart, and cauſe the cheſt to be delivered unto me, according to your promiſe? Gentlewoman (ſaid the Princeſs) I have made you promiſe thereof, and I will kéep it, alth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Take it when you will, you ſhall find it in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame place where yeſternight you cauſed it to be ſet: with that the Ladies and gentlewomen being advertiſed of her riſing came into her chamber, which hindered <hi>Leonorine</hi> to ſpeak ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly with <hi>Carmelle</hi> as ſhe would have done, but onely gave her the key of the cheſt, which ſhe cauſed to be taken out of the tomb: that done, <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ndalin</hi> and <hi>Enil,</hi> and the two Squires, took it up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéen them and carried it away, <hi>Leonorine</hi> ſaying to <hi>Carmelle:</hi> I pray you thank the knight (in my behalf) that hath had me in ſo good remembrance. And find the means if it be poſſible that (according to the promiſe and meſſages he hath often ſent unto the Emperor, part whereof have bin done by your ſelf) he will as ſoon as he can, come hither to ſée us. Madam (ſaid ſhe) I will do it with all my heart, as ſhe that deſireth to pleaſe, ſerve and obey you. Fail not then (ſaid the Princeſs) and ſo God have you in his kéeping. That done, <hi>Carmelle</hi> followed them that carried <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> leaving <hi>Leonorine</hi> accompanied both with joy &amp; ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: with joy, to have ſéen him that ſhe held dearer then her ſelf, and with ſadneſs, for his ſo ſudden departure. But the hope ſhe had of his ſpéedy return, eaſed her grief much. <hi>Carmelle</hi> having brought her purpoſe to paſs as you heard before, deſiring not to omit any thing that ſéemed neceſſary to be done: and to avoid all ſuſpition, ſent <hi>Gandalin</hi> and <hi>Enil</hi> before unto the ſhips, and went unto the Emperor, whom ſhe found walking in the gallery who no ſooner perceived her, but he asked if the Preſent that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ſent unto his daughter, were yet in her ſhip. No my Lord, (ſaid ſhe) I cauſed it yeſternight to be carried into her chamber as I promiſed you, and have left it all with her, onely that which was given me for my part. What is that? (ſaid the Emperor.) The Cedar Cheſt (ſaid ſhe:) wherein (if it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God) I will cauſe the body of <hi>Matroco</hi> to be buried, that as yet lieth in my fathers Hermitage. But my lord, becauſe as this morning I determined to ſayl unto the Caſtle <hi>the defended

Gentlewoman (ſaid the Emperor) when you were laſt here, I ſent him word by you, what joy and great pleaſure it would be unto me for to ſée him here, I pray you once again ſhew him what I ſaid: Aſſuring him, that being here, he ſhall have of me all honor and good entertainment we can deviſe. My Lord (ſaid <hi>Carmelle</hi>) God preſerve your Grace and ſend you life: And therewith taking her leave, ſhe returned into her ſhip, where <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and his company ſtayed for her.</p>

                  <hi>ESplandian</hi> entred into his ſhip, and <hi>Carmelle</hi> being returned as it is ſaid before, they determined not to ſtay longer, fearing to be diſcovered: wherefore they cauſed ankers to be hoiſed, and ſetting ſayl, made towards the Caſtle <hi>the defended mountain,</hi> but fortune by a great ſtorm and contrary wind car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them another way, driving them along the coaſt of <hi>Alfarin,</hi> where the wind ceaſed, they ſayling almoſt hard by the ſhore, and at the ſame inſtant when they eſpyed among the Rockes certain horſe and footmen fighting together: whereat <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> marvelled, and ſaid unto <hi>Gandalin</hi> and <hi>Enil:</hi> I pray you, ſéeing we are arrived here at this inſtant, let us go ſée from whence the occaſion of their combate procéedeth, and if we may, help them that have the juſteſt quarrel.

                  </gap>ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, they knew their companions by the white croſſes they bare upon their armor, and ſéeing them in danger, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed on all ſides by great number of Turks, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his horſe over the ſtones, and entered into the preaſe, but not very far, by reaſon the Turks kept a ſtrait place, where he muſt paſs, from whence at the firſt he was repulſed: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in the end <hi>Gandalin</hi> and <hi>Enil</hi> ſeconded him ſo well with the
<pb facs="tcp:57308:88"/>
help of thoſe that fought on the other ſide, that notwithſtanding the great reſiſtance the Turks made, they incloſed them on all ſides, and beat them down: yet ſome of them by the ſwiftneſs of their horſes ſaved themſelves, whereby the Chriſtians remained victors, not loſing one man. The knights that had béen aided in the manner, could not imagine which way y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other thrée knights came: but when they knew them, never were men gladder, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God of his great mercy ſhewed unto them. Wherewith <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandian</hi> asked them how they came thither: My lord (ſaid <hi>Elian le delibere,</hi>) I and my companions had ſo much intreated <hi>Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> to lead us into the country, that all this night he hath ben our guide: we being iſſued out of <hi>Alfarin,</hi> thinking to ſurpriſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> town of <hi>Galatia</hi> that lieth upon the ſea-ſide not far from hence, and to the ſame end we ſtayed in ambuſh, but perceiving our enterpriſe to be diſcovered, &amp; thinking by little and little to retire, we were incloſed in ſuch manner, that if God had not helpen us by your means, without doubt we had al béen overthrown and deſtroyed. By the faith of a knight (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) if you had conſidered the country where we are, and that the loſs of one of our men is greater to us then a thouſand others, if we were in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, you would not have hazarded your ſelves ſo much: but what is paſt, cannot be undone. And to the end we ſpéed no worſe, let us enter into my ſhip that ſtayeth for me. My Lord <hi>Eſplandian</hi> (ſaid <hi>Belleris</hi>) Occaſion is offered now unto us, and let him go that refuſeth it, when time ſerveth. You ſée the overthrow of the Turkes, which is ſuch, that I certainly believe, there is not one man left within the Town. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am of opinion, that we ride thither in as ſecret manner as we may, then if we ſée occaſion, we will ſet upon the gates, and it may be ſhall enter the Town without reſiſtance, mean time ſend one of your Squires to certifie your ſaylers, that they ſayl unto <hi>Alfarin,</hi> or elſe that they ſtir not from thence before they hear news of us. This counſel liked them well, and they all agreed unto it: with that <hi>Belleris</hi> marched on before, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and the reſt following after, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cloſe together upon a Cauſie, where not far from thence they eſpyed one ſitting upon a ſharp Rock moſt hideous to
<pb facs="tcp:57308:89"/>
behold, whereat they ſpurred their horſes thither to ſee what it might be, where they ſaw a woman ſo old, impotent, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, that her breaſts hung down beneath her navil, apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in a Bears skin, whereon hung her long, white, and knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hair, where ſhe had lived among thoſe Rockes in all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts and ſtormy weathers for the ſpace of ſix ſcore years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. By which means, her naked body ſhewed like the bark of an Elm trée or ſome ancient Oke, whereby not one of them but began to laugh, asking <hi>Belleris</hi> if he had heard of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. I truly (ſaid he) for ſhe is ſo near of linage to King <hi>Armato,</hi> that ſhe was his great Grandfathers Siſter. And although that in her yong years ſhe hath béen indued with all the gifts of nature, yet would ſhe never marry, what means ſoever her friends could uſe, but gave her ſelf continually to ſtudy the Art of Magick, in ſuch ſhort, that none could ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs her in the ſame, whereby ſhe hath foreſhown long time ſince, that before ſhe died, the land of Turky ſhould be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, and brought in ſubjection unto ſtrangers. And for this cauſe ſhe hath cauſed this Rock to be hewen, wherein ſhe hath made two chambers, where continually ſhe abideth, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrelled in the ſame manner you now behold her, and as it is commonly reported, ſhe is very near nineſcore years of age, and that you may know her better, it is ſhe that cauſed the gilt pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars with the Tables hanging at them, to be ſet up at the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous fountain, which you my Lord <hi>Eſplandian</hi> (ſaid he) might peradventure ſée, when you found the Princeſs <hi>Heliaxe,</hi> and overthrew her guard in that place. Truly (ſaid <hi>Eſplandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>) I would gladly know how ſhe paſſeth the time, being ſo ſolitary as ſhe is. My Lord, (ſaid <hi>Belleris</hi>) that could never be known, yet it is thought, that ſhe hath carryed great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of books into the Cave, wherewith ſhe delighteth her ſelf. I marvel (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) why no man ever adventured to go into the Rock? So they have done: (ſaid <hi>Belleris</hi>) but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again ſo well beaten and cruelly handled, that at their coming forth, ſome of them dyed. Let us ſpeak unto her (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) and it may be ſhe will tell us no goodneſs: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they went néerer unto her, but ſhe preſently roſe up and
<pb facs="tcp:57308:89"/>
fled into her Cave, at the entery whereof ſhe ſtayed, ſaying to <hi>Eſplandian:</hi> Knight, Above a hundred years before thou waſt born, I did foreſhew the deſtruction of this country by thy arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val here, therefore I chuſe rather to lead this miſerable and cruel life, then to fall into thy hands, and live in miſerable captivity. With that ſhe went in, and could no more be ſéen, whereat they all began to laugh, and without longer ſtaying went on their way, wherein they perceived coming towards them about ſixty or fourſcore Knights, all armed ready to fight: whereupon doubting them to be enemies, they ſtood ſtill, cauſing <hi>Enil</hi> and <hi>Belleris</hi> to ride forwards to know the truth, who croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the field, and ſtaying under a tuff of Cork, they perceived one of the company to bear a red ancient with a white croſs, and therewith they knew <hi>Frandalo</hi> that ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

took this way to follow him, but for that neither we nor you have met with any company to provoke us to fight, I pray you let us return again the beſt way we can unto <hi>Alfarin:</hi> but my Lord (ſaid he) what adventure hath brought you hither in ſo good time to find us here? What adventure (ſaid he?) Truly you may well tearm it ſo: for <hi>Gandalin, Enil,</hi> and I, thinking to ſail un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Caſtle <hi>the defended mountain,</hi> fortune by tempeſt of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, drave our Ship ſo near this coaſt, that we might plainly behold <hi>Belleris</hi> and his company fighting againſt a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the enemy, that had driven them among the rocks: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we landed, and entered ſo far among the enemies, that in the end the victory was ours: after that by your nephews coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel we were riding towards <hi>Galatie,</hi> the which (as he aſſureth us) will be eaſily gotten without great reſiſtance, conſidering the overthrow we have already given them.

But I know
<pb facs="tcp:57308:92"/>
his mind full well, he means to content us with words, and many meſſages that from time to time he ſendeth, together with an infinite number of excuſes, but all to no purpoſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of while I live I will not accept one of them for his diſcharge: let him therefore come himſelf, and then it may be I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that to be in him, I have ſo oftentimes heard reported. When the Emperor heard her ſpeak in that ſort, he ſhowed by his countenance that he took great pleaſure at his daughters choler, and ſaid unto her: My ſwéet friend, what will <hi>Ganda, lin</hi> ſay to ſée you ſo uncourteous towards him, that honoreth you ſo much: I pray you ſwéet-heart moderate your choler, and take that he ſendeth, for if you refuſe it, he ſhall have great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to diſlike thereof: And you ſée that for your ſake he doth ſo many valiant acts, that the good Knight with the Gréen Sword could never do the like. My Lord (ſaid ſhe) I believe for valor he is not inferior unto his father, but for courteſie his father ſurpaſſeth him. In faith Madam (ſaid <hi>Gandalin</hi>) if you knew him as well as I do, it may be you would commend him more then now you blaſpheme him, ſéeing that if he hath deferred the time to come hither, it is onely becauſe he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth he hath not as yet done ſufficient in arms, whereby he ſhould deſerve one ſpark of favor at your hands, conſidering your eſtate and the ſmall valor that is in him, although at this day he is eſtéemed the beſt Knight that ever bare arms for theſe hundred years Nevertheleſs, ſéeing you accuſe him of that, that ought moſt to excuſe him, I promiſe you of mine honor, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all things apart, preſently upon my return he ſhall come hither unto you, to do whatſoever it ſhall pleaſe you to command him. <hi>Gandalin</hi> (ſaid the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine</hi>) think not (whatſoever I ſay) that I either take pleaſure or diſpleaſure at his preſence or his abſence, but onely as my Father doth, and I for his ſake, knowing the great love and affection he hath always born to King <hi>Amadis</hi> his Father, and continued <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

he hath ſent me, upon the promiſe and aſſurance you have made of his coming hither as ſoon as you ſhall be arrived at <hi>Galatia.</hi> Truly <hi>Leonorine</hi> played her part, very cunningly here: for hardly would it have béen thought or once imagined, that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and ſhe had ſo faithfully given their hands and hearts as they had done in the preſence of Quéen <hi>Minoreſſe,</hi> as you heard before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; <hi>Gandalin</hi> for his part knew not what to think although he had born <hi>Eſplandian</hi> in the tomb, and ſet him in her chamber as you likewiſe heard. Then the Emperor asked him how long he meant to ſtay. My lord (ſaid <hi>Gandalin</hi>) as little as I may, for it were not fit forme to live at reſt, while my compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are in arms: Wherefore I moſt humbly beſéech your Grace to give me my diſpatch as ſoon as poſsible you can. <hi>Gandalin,</hi> (ſaid the Emperor) I will preſently ſend for my admiral, &amp; will cauſe men in al haſte to be prepared, that within ſix or ſeven days they ſhall be ready to depart.

And to ſay the truth, I have known many men troubled with the paſſions of love, but I certainly believe there was never his like, nor that more wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could diſſemble it, which maketh me greatly to doubt his perſon. For that it is impoſsible, conſidering the grief he ſtill indureth, together with the ſmall comfort he received of his familiar friends, (not knowing his diſeaſe) but that he muſt in ſhort time end his days: whereby great dammage ſhould then ariſe unto all Chriſtendom, conſidering the ſtrange begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Knighthood and great proweſs that is in him: which is ſuch, as that if he continue as he hath begun, he will bring that Order in greater eſtimation then ever it hath béen before: wherefore Madam, ſéeing I have always (as it may be you are already adver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(upon <hi>Belleris</hi> word) that it is at the leaſt eight or nine ſcore years ſince ſhe firſt could go and ſpeak, yet hath ſhe ſo freſh and gallant a colour, that to behold her well, I cannot compare her better then unto the bark of thoſe great Elms we commonly find along the high ways as we ride in great <hi>Brittain,</hi> her hair is as white as Snow, and for want of combing all knotted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which ſetteth her out ſo well, that to behold it ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad upon a bears skin (which ſhe weareth for a gown,) there is not any man living that would not be ſurpriſed with a ſudden and vehement love, in the beholding of her. <hi>Urganda</hi> that had heard of her before, and above all things was much deſirous to ſée her, becauſe of her great skill, ſaid unto <hi>Eſplandian:</hi> In good faith I know her better then you think I do, and am well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that in her yong years ſhe hath bin one of the goodlieſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that ever you ſaw. For ſhe is both daughter, ſiſter, and aunt unto a King, and is called <hi>Melie,</hi> who for to learn the perfect art and ſcience of Nigromancy, hath ſo much condemned the world, that for her inheritance ſhe hath choſen a Rock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein ſhe hath cauſed a cave to be digged, where ſhe now remaineth and liveth in great miſery, and I ſwear unto you of my faith, that it is above twenty years and more ſince I determined to come and ſée her, but other affairs that touched me néerer, have ſtill hindered my deſire.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray you come neer, and ſit down by me. <hi>Urganda</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vrng her to be old and feeble, did as ſhe required, hoping by force to ſtay her there, whether ſhe would or no, till her company were come thither, minding to give her unto them to bring her to <hi>Galatia,</hi> but ſhe met with as crafty a mate as her ſelf, for the old woman perceiving <hi>Urganda</hi> to be neer her, went unto the mouth of her Cave, and ſaid unto her: <hi>Urganda,</hi> It would grief me that theſe Knights ſhould hear our talk, wherefore let us go in. Whereat <hi>Urganda</hi> made no difficulty, thinking verily, that if ſhe might once lay hands on her, ſhe would uſe her at her pleaſure: wherewith ſhe followed her, but ſhe was no ſooner entered, but <hi>Melie</hi> ſtepped to her and held her ſo ſtraight by the threat, that ſhe had no means to call <hi>Eſplandian</hi> or any of the reſt to help her. But they fearing the worſt, ran in all haſte un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cave, and the firſt that entred was <hi>Talanque,</hi> and after him <hi>Manley,</hi> and they had no ſooner ſtepped in, but they fell down as if they had béen dead, and their fall was ſo great, that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> that followed them heard it, but he had a remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him againſt all ſuch adventures, and that was his good Sword againſt the which no inchantment whatſoever could ought avail, which he firſt found to be true when he entred into <hi>Arcabonnes</hi> chamber: he perceiving his two companions in ſuch caſe, being much grieved thereat, willingly would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved them, but that he eſpyed <hi>Melie</hi> holding <hi>Urganda</hi> under her knee, ſeeking by all means to ſtrangle her: which cauſed him firſt to ſuccor her, threatning <hi>Melie</hi> if that ſhe did her hurt, ſhe ſhould dearly buy it, but for all his threatnings ſhe ceaſed not to uſe all the means ſhe could for to deſtroy her, until <hi>Eſplandian</hi> went neer unto her, and with his Sword thought to cleave her

head. Wherewith ſhe began to flie, thinking to be ſafe within the chamber where ſhe wrought her charms, but as ſhe ſtepped upon the threſhold of the door, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> caught her by the bears skin, and whether ſhe would or not, held her ſo faſt, that ſhe could go no further. And as he lifted up his arm to kill her, he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred that he ſhould do wrong, thinking it not convenient for a Knight to defile his hands in the blood of a ſimple woman nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reſiſt: and ſurely the thought of his, moderated his colour in ſuch ſort, that he purpoſed not to do it, minding onely to draw her out of the vault: wherewith he took her by the hair, and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her with all his force. With that he eſpyed a great old Ape, with two eyes burning like flaming fire, that lept upon him for to tear his fleſh, but he gave him ſuch a blow with his fiſt betwéen the eyes, that he ſtroke him dead. And paſsing forward, brought <hi>Melie</hi> out of her Cave, and leaving her in <hi>Frandalos</hi> kéeping, went in again to ſée if <hi>Urganda</hi> were alive, where he found her in ſuch pain, that it ſéemed the ſoul would depart out of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whereat he had ſo great pity, that he took her in his arms, and ſet her in the air, the like he did to <hi>Talanque</hi> and <hi>Manley,</hi> who within one quarter of an hour after, could not call to mind what had happened unto them, but were as whole and as well as ever they were before. Wherefore they mounted on their horſes, taking <hi>Melie</hi> with them that ſat upon <hi>Sergils</hi> horſe, and he behind her, holding her in his arms, leſt ſhe ſhould eſcape. And God knows with what joy <hi>Urganda</hi> ſhewed them what fear ſhe had bin in, which as ſhe ſaid was ſuch, that ſhe thought verily to die. But (ſaid ſhe) even as one nail driveth out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo the joy I have of my delivery, maketh me in a manner to forget the pain wherein I was.

Then he asked them how they got away.

unto you, whereof at this preſent the Chriſtians are Lords and Maſters, having conquered it from you by force, not finding any Garriſon therein, but a number of women and little children: which my Lord <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and his company ſend unto your Grace, committing them unto your good diſcretion. Aſſuring you (their Religion onely excepted) they are ready to do you any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that they may. <hi>Carmelle</hi> (ſaid the Princeſs) this is not the firſt favor they have ſhewed unto me, I am of long time ſo much beholding to them, that be it in their adverſities or their proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, I will never be unmindful of the ſame.

ſhewed them what ſhe had done, as alſo what ſpéeches the prince <hi>Alphorax</hi> uſed unto her, which <hi>Urganda</hi> marked well, ſaying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the knights: In faith my good friends, as touching <hi>Alpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax</hi> high words, they are the fruits of his nature, being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proud and arrogant: Nevertheleſs, I can aſſure you, that fortune promiſeth him great matters. And becauſe it will not be long before they do happen, I will now uſe no words of them: praying ſome of you to ſhew me ſo much favor to return again unto <hi>Melies</hi> Cave, to fetch her Books that we left behinde us. Which being in my poſſeſsion, it may be they will ſerve here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to do both you and many others pleaſure. <hi>Eſplandian</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Urganda</hi> ſpeak with ſuch affection, and knowing the deſire ſhe had to have the Books, anſwered her and ſaid: Madam, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſtéep I will ſée if I can fulfil your pleaſure. And without longer ſtaying, he deſired <hi>Enil, Frandalo,</hi> and <hi>Gandalin,</hi> to bear him company: who preſently armed themſelves, and being on horſeback without any other company then their own Squires, iſſued out of the Town, leaving <hi>Urganda</hi> with <hi>Norandel,</hi> that was newly come from the City of <hi>Alfarin.</hi> The four Knights rode ſo long till they came unto <hi>Melies</hi> rock, where not far from thence they found thrée Giants and twelve Knights, that with a loud voice ſtood at the mouth of the Cave calling <hi>Melie,</hi> for the ſhepheards kéeping ſhéep in the fields (having ſéen her led unto <hi>Galatia</hi>) ran to tell them news: and to know the truth they were expreſly come thither. <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and his company knew them well to be their enemies, wherfore they determin'd to give them battel although their number was far greater: wherefore being covered with their ſhields, and their ſwords ready in their hands, they entred among them, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> met the firſt Giant, <hi>Frandalo</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Gandalin</hi> and <hi>Enil</hi> the third: and <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> gave his giant ſo great a blow, that therewith he made him take ſo great a leap, that both maſter and horſe lay upon the ground, not once removing hand or foot: but it fell out otherwiſe with the reſt, for they having broken their ſpears upon <hi>Franda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo, Gandalin,</hi> and <hi>Enil,</hi> their horſes being looſely bridled, bare them at leaſt a mile from thence, before they could make them ſtay. With that the four Chriſtian Knights were incloſed by twelve
<pb facs="tcp:57308:99"/>
Turks, whereof thrée of them at the firſt charge were ſtricken dead unto the ground: wherewith the fight began to be moſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous and fierce, in ſuch ſort, that before the two Giants could return again, five other of the Turks were in ſuch caſe, that the beſt of them was hurt to death, ſo there reſted but four: which <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and <hi>Frandalo</hi> left fighting with <hi>Gandalin</hi> and <hi>Enil,</hi> to méet the two Giants that in great haſte came towards them to help their companions: and as they met together never was there braver fight, for <hi>Eſplandian</hi> thinking upon the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine,</hi> gave not one blow but he made the blood to follow on him that had the ſtroke: whereby the rock became all bloody, yet he found his enemy no leſs able to require his blows, ſo that in ſhort ſpace his ſhield was ſo hewed and cut in pieces, that there reſted nothing but the leathers in his hands: whereat he was in ſuch a rage, that riſing in his ſtirr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And to ſay truth, it was not poſſible for them to make any reſiſtance: yet he ſtayed a while, becauſe he perceived ſome of them that were ſtricken down to riſe again, and take their Swords in hand: whereat he turned about, but it chanced that his horſes foot lighting betwéen a cliff ſtuck faſt, and was forced to fall down, whereby <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> was in the greateſt danger of death that ever he had, by reaſon that his enemies were on all ſides about him ready to thruſt their Swords into his belly: a thing very eaſie to be done if God had not provided for him, and given ſtrength and agility

to his horſe to riſe again with his maſter on his back: who perceiving himſelf at liberty, and having his Sword in hand, made ſuch execution on the Turks, that he left not one alive: wherewith thoſe two that fought with <hi>Gandalin</hi> and <hi>Enil</hi> fled along the mountain, as if all the devils in hell had béen behind them, and not being purſued ſaved themſelves, leaving the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant behind them for a pawn, to whom <hi>Frandalo</hi> granted life, not onely becauſe he asked mercy, but for that he was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner dead.</p>

                  <p>How <hi>Eſplandian</hi> entred into <hi>Melies</hi> Cave, to fetch her books, and of an aſſault made upon him, <hi>Frandalo, Enil,</hi> and <hi>Gandalin,</hi> as they thought to return again unto <hi>Galatia.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe combate ended as you heard before, each man cauſed his wounds to be dreſſed and bound up in the beſt manner they could: then <hi>Eſplandian</hi> entred into <hi>Melies</hi> Cave to fetch the books he ſought, where he went into a fair chamber being four ſquare, about the which there grew ſo much Ivy, that it might verily be judged to have béen placed there for the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the chamber: in this chamber at each corner there hung four Lamps, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> burnt both night &amp; day and never went forth, ſo cunningly could the Enchantreſs ſhew her Art in that place: and as <hi>Eſplandian</hi> looked well about him, he eſpyed the door of another chamber, in the middle whereof ſtood a great Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick all of Maſſy Gold with ſeven branches, and in every branch a wax Candle that burned continually: hard by it ſtood a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres-table, whereon lay <hi>Melies</hi> books, ſome covered with plates of Gold and graven upon it, others with Silver, bound and emboiſed round about, which <hi>Eſplandian</hi> took and carried with him out of the Cave, giving them to kéep unto his Squire, and mounting on their horſes, they rode the ſame way they came, thinking preſently to be at <hi>Galatia</hi> again. But they were ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſooner than they looked for, for the Turks that fled away (as you heard before) made an Alarum at a little Town not far from thence, whereby there iſſued twenty horſe and forty foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb facs="tcp:57308:100"/>
who being aſſured that four Knights onely and no more had overthrown their men, made all the ſpéed they could to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe them, eſpecially thoſe that were well horſed: <hi>Frandalo</hi> and his company perceived them afar off yet could they hardly ſhun them, but of force muſt fight, or elſe endure the ſhame to flie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Wherefore <hi>Eſplandian</hi> was in mind to try their fortune, and to ſend one of their Squires in all haſte unto <hi>Galatia,</hi> to advertiſe them of the danger they were in, that they might ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor them: whereto <hi>Frandalo</hi> would not give conſent, ſhewing what great pain and travel both they and their horſes had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured all that day, as alſo the great number of their enemies in regard of them, in ſuch ſort (ſaid he) that if we take upon us for to fight with them, I am in doubt, that thinking to win honor, we ſhall be counted raſh and preſumptuous fools. What then? (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) will you endure the ſhame to flie away? In good truth (ſaid he) for my part I had rather endure the hazard of life or death, what ever ſhall happen. Then we will do thus (ſaid <hi>Frandalo:</hi>) my Squire ſhall run unto <hi>Galatia</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe <hi>Talanque</hi> and the reſt how we ſtayed behind. Mean time, I know a bridge not far from hence, whether we will go and defend the ſame, till our aid ſhall come, where we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be aſſailed by them all at once: otherwiſe think with your ſelf what meanes we have to reſiſt ſo many men both on horſe and foot, that come purpoſely to aſſayl us. Let us go then (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) wherewith leaving the way on the right hand they turned to the left, as <hi>Frandalo</hi> led them: and they had not ridden very far but they came unto a little river ſomewhat déep, over the which there ſtood a bridge, where they had no ſooner arrived, but they were preſently charged by their enemies, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially by one of the Turks that was moſt brave and ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and beſt mounted of them all, as being their captain: who bearing a great launce in his hand, began to cry moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently in the <hi>Arabian</hi> tongue unto <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, ſaying: You dogs, you fly away, but by our gods it ſhall coſt you all your lives: wherewith <hi>Enil</hi> that heard his threatnings better than the reſt, turned his face, and ſet ſpurs to his horſe, the Turk and he méeting ſo fiercely together, that
<pb facs="tcp:57308:100"/>
                  <hi>Enil</hi> was hurt in the right arm, and the Turk thruſt clean through the body, wherewith he fell preſently ſtark dead unto the ground: Which ſet his companions in ſuch a rage to ſée their champion thus ſuddenly ſlain, that they thought to incloſe <hi>Enil,</hi> but he found means to recover the bridge: ſurely whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had ſéen the great proweſs of thoſe four champions, might with good reaſon eſtéem them as they were, ſpecially <hi>Eſplandian</hi> that ſtroke not one blow in vain. And although they were but few in compariſon of their enemies, yet they did twice or thrice overthrow divers of the Turks that ſéemed boldeſt to adventure forward, in ſuch ſort, that had it not béen for the footmen that came upon them, the horſemen had but little prevailed: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at it is not to be marvelled, becauſe the greateſt part of them were Citizens, altogether unexpert in arms, and fitter for ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket at a table than to guide a horſe or break a launce: whereby in leſs than a quarter of an hour the four Knights had done them great hurt: and ſo much, that neither the horſemen nor footmen durſt once ſet forward to enter upon the bridge, till one of them determined to make proof, thereby if it were poſſible to incloſe them round about. This Turks name was <hi>Tluacam,</hi> a valiant and hardy knight, as he well ſhewed before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate ended: for although the water was déep and the other ſide hard to climb up, yet he waded through, and at divers times bare eight more of his companions over: which <hi>Frandalo</hi> and the reſt perceiving, they were conſtrained to divide themſelves, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and <hi>Enil</hi> ſtaying at the end of the Bridge where the combate firſt began, <hi>Frandalo</hi> and <hi>Gandalin</hi> ſtanding at the other, and God knows what trouble they had, for <hi>Tluacam</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to win honor or to looſe his life, with his lance in hand, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Gandalin</hi> in ſuch ſort, that both man and horſe had like to fallen to the ground, and withal he brake his ſpear: wherefore taking his Sword in hand, ſtriking on both ſides, and thinking to be ſeconded by his fellows, put his horſe in ſuch a fury, that whether he would or not, he bare him to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> middle of the bridge: where thinking to ſtay, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> horſes féet ſlid from him, whereby both he and his maſter fell into the river and were drowned whereat the Turks gave ſo great a cry, that they ſéemed mad, and
<pb facs="tcp:57308:101"/>
bowing down their heads thinking to acquit their loſs, uſed all the force they could on both ſides the bridge to enter upon the four knights: who ſuſtained their aſſault ſo bravely, that the Turks at laſt were forced to recoil, whereof nine were thrown into the water, but <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and his company were ſo weary, that in a manner they could fight no longer. With that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their aid in all haſte coming towards them: the occaſion why they ſtayed ſo long was becauſe <hi>Frenace, Frandalos</hi> ſquire, that went to ſéek <hi>Manley</hi> and the reſt, thinking to find his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter where he left him, had led them thither, but not finding them there, ſupp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſed them to be gone unto the bridge: &amp; to ſay truth, they arrived in very good time, for that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and his thrée companions were almoſt clean out of breath: but when they perceived their aid, never did poor priſoners that were ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty more rejoyce, nor were better pleaſed: and the Turks on the contrary ſide never more aſtoniſhed, yet they held cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, determining rather to revenge their deaths than once to yield unto their enemies: ſo that before the Knights of <hi>Galatia</hi> could enter in among them, they gave them much to do, although in the end they overcame them, whereby not one eſcaped alive, to carry news unto their friends. <hi>Enil</hi> at the firſt onſet had béen ſore wounded, as you heard before, wherefore he cauſed his wounds to be ſearched: the like did the reſt of the hurt Knights. Which done they ſet forward to <hi>Galatia,</hi> contenting themſelves for that day with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> victory it had pleaſed God to ſend them. And coming to the gate, they found <hi>Urganda</hi> ready to receive them: who knowing how all had paſt, and the danger wherein <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> had béen, jeſtingly ſaid unto him: In faith my Lord, ſaid ſhe, if I were afraid of death when I fell into <hi>Melies</hi> hands, I believe you were not in much better caſe ſince that I ſaw you laſt, as I underſtand by thoſe that know what dammage you were in. Madam (ſaid he) I know I am a mortal man, and that my life and death are in the hands of God, as it pleaſeth him to diſpoſe, and I confeſs unto you, if we had not béen ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cored, that in the end we could not have endured: yet am I well aſſured, that before it had come to paſs, we had laid ſo many enemies on the ground, that the reſt ſhould have had greater

cauſe to lament their loſs, than boaſt of their conqueſt. <hi>Urganda</hi> perceived by <hi>Eſplandian</hi> words that he liked not her ſpéech, whereupon ſhe ſaid unto him: My Lord, pardon me I beſéech you, and excuſe the indiſcretion of a woman, ſpecially in me, who at this preſent had forgotten my ſelf. Madam (ſaid <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>) you may command me, and likewiſe ſet me forth for a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, hardy, or any other what it pleaſeth you to tearm me. In which manner talking together, they came unto his lodging, where maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (newly come from <hi>Alfarin</hi>) viſited his wounds, and the reſt likewiſe that had cauſe to uſe his help.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THe Knights that had béen hurt at the laſt encounter, for the ſpace of fiftéen days after were forced to kéep their cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers until their wounds were healed: during which time, <hi>Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda</hi> took great pleaſure in reading <hi>Melies</hi> books which <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> cauſed to be brought unto her: wherein ſhe found ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful conjurations and deviſes of Magick Art, that ſhe was abaſhed how ſhe that had them ſo long time in her poſſeſſion, knew no more than yet ſhe did, eſtéeming the Enchantreſs La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to have béen the perfecteſt ſcholar that even ſtudied in that art, as it well appeared by her books.

faith and the ſervice of God, that ſhall reward you for it: and to the end you may continue in this forwardneſs, &amp; that the thing which I pretend, may happily fall out, I will from henceforth not onely imploy my perſon by my Art, which hath pleaſed God to lend me, wherewith I will adviſe you what I ſhall find con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and neceſſary for the augmentation of your honors al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpread through out the world: which to begin I am of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that you all imbarque your ſelves with me in the great Serpent, that ſhall bring us unto <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, for without him it is impoſſible that this great enterpriſe you have taken in hand can come to good effect: as alſo that he himſelf before many years are paſt, ſhall be found in marvellous neceſſity, and ſuch, that he ſhall account himſelf moſt happy to have your aid: and with good reaſon, for that in the end both he and you ſhall overcome thoſe hazards according to your deſires. Then ſhall you plainly know, that this that I foreſhew unto you is moſt true. While <hi>Urganda</hi> uſed theſe words, all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſtood ſtill intentive for to hear her: and had it not béen that they eſtéemed her words to be moſt true, they had doubted of the threatnings ſhe uſed againſt the Emperor, he being ſo great and puiſſant a Monarch. Nevertheleſs the iſſue of that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which ſhe aſſured unto them, gave them ſome eaſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation of mind: in expectation whereof, they made account in the mean time to prove their ſtrengths and forces, that thereby their valor and magnanimity might be further ſpread abroad. And as touching their voyage to the Emperor, as <hi>Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda</hi> gave them direction, it was onely the thing whereupon <hi>Eſplandian</hi> did aſpire, hoping that if the wars were openly proclaimed in the Grecian Empire, and the Emperors dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſo imminent, to ſhew ſuch valor and proweſs in martial exploits, that he would not onely frée and acquit his father of the promiſe he had made to ſerve the Ladies, but confirm the love that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princeſs <hi>Leonorine</hi> bare unto him, in ſuch ſort, that he might obtain her for his wife: which cauſed him to ſpeak for all his company, aſſuring <hi>Urganda</hi> that not one of them but was ready to obay and go where it pleaſed her.

Thus was their voyage to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> agréed upon, in ſuch ſort, that all the knights of great <hi>Brittain</hi> entred into the great Serpent, taking with them <hi>Frandola, Melie,</hi> and the captain of <hi>Teſifant</hi> that had béen taken priſoner, as you heard before, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Admirals ſouldiers for garriſon in the town.

Then <hi>Urganda</hi> cauſed her Knights to be armed with the armor ſhe had brought, which were white, with a red croſs both before and behind, moſt comely to behold.

Being arrived, the ſhip was preſently eſpyed by the Citizens which they knew, having ſéen it before when it put them in ſuch fear, as you have heard, but hoping for him that uſed ordinarily to ſayl therein, they all ran unto the walls, and along the ſhore to ſée him land, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

the noiſe and rumor was ſo great, that the Emperor had news thereof being as then talking with the Ladies.

Wherefore fearing to be deceived as ſhe had béen before, ſhe began to change colour: which Quéen <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noreſſe</hi> perceived, and jeſting ſaid unto her: Madam, do you make this pitiful countenance to diſſemble the joy you have conceived, or for fear I ſhould beguile you of him that cometh to ſée you? How now couſin (ſaid ſhe) how long have you learned to mock? In faith I never thought upon the firſt of thoſe two points, and much leſs am I in doubt of the ſecond, for you know as much as my ſelf and yet I am not ignorant that when the great Serpent was there where I now behold it, he whom we expect came not hither, wherefore I fear (and with good reaſon) that we ſhall now be ſerved in like ſort: and as ſhe ended her ſpéech, the ſhip came within a bow ſhot of the haven where they might perceive one of her ſides to open, from whence they put out a boat, and not long after they ſaw <hi>Carmelle</hi> and two other gentlewomen come forth, the two Gentlewomen playing moſt ſwéetly upon two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, which they did till they arrived at the ſhore: from whence they went unto the Emperor, who knowing <hi>Carmelle,</hi> had better hope to ſée <hi>Eſplandian</hi> than ever he had before: &amp; going unto her to ask what news, ſhe made no more reverence unto him than ſhe uſed at other times to do, ſaying unto him: My lord, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> my maſter (that you ſo much deſire to ſée) is now ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived before the town in the great Serpent with divers other Knights his friends and allies, and <hi>Urganda la Diſcogneve,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring you to ſhew them the favor to ſtay in your Pallace, where they mean to come and viſit your Grace. Truly <hi>Carmelle</hi> (ſaid the Emperor) I never heard meſſage in all my life that pleaſed me ſo well, I am content to do as they deſire, although I was determined to méet them, and to give them that entertainment they deſerve: But ſéeing they will have it otherwiſe, I will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their deſires. That is ſufficient (ſaid <hi>Carmelle</hi>) we will
<pb facs="tcp:57308:103"/>
then return to thom again, to certifie your Graces anſwer. Go (ſaid the Emperor) and tell them from me, that they ſhall he moſt heartily welcome. With that <hi>Carmelle</hi> with the two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen departed towards the Haven: mean time, whoſoever had beheld the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine,</hi> might eaſily have judged the alteration of her heart, it was ſo full of joy, that without Quéen <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> that cauſed her to refrain, ſhe would perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture have done ſomething whereby her honor had béen ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed, minding to leave the Empreſs her mother, and go to méet <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> whoſe abſence had procured ſo great ſorrow in her mind. But the Quéen as a wiſe and diſcréet lady perſwaded her ſo much, that ſhe ſtayed at the window, whereby her altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might not be perceived. <hi>Carmelle</hi> ſtayed not long, but went into the boat, rowing to the great Serpent, where being ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, there were preſently two boats more put forth that brought horſes to land, which done, they returned again to fetch the knights, and thoſe that would went forth, and among them ſix gentlewomen, thrée of them ſounding the recorders, then cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, the other thrée played on the Lute and Vials, in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner being landed and mounted on their horſes, they entred into the City the ſix Gentlewomen marching firſt, after them the two Turkiſh Captains that were taken at the ſiege of the Caſtle <hi>the defended mountain,</hi> then the Captain of <hi>Teſifant,</hi> next followed <hi>Armato,</hi> and with him the Princeſs <hi>Melie,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrelled in the bear-skin as ſhe had béen taken, then followed the forty Knights two in a rank, armed horſe and man in one ſort of armor, in the middeſt of them road <hi>Urganda,</hi> talking to <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi> And as they approached the Pallace, the Emperor, the Empreſs, and the Ladies met them, where the Emperor coming to <hi>Urganda,</hi> did her as much honor as if ſhe had bin the greateſt Quéen in the world. Mean time the Knights being among the Ladies, gave occaſion to be found no leſs courteous, then prompt and valiant in arms, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> who coming to the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine,</hi> knéeled on the ground to kiſs her hands, but ſhe refuſed it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the whole company believe, ſhe was offended with him for delaying the time to come unto the court as he had promiſed.
<pb facs="tcp:57308:104"/>
Which the Emperor perceiving, could not refrain to ſmile, and ſaid unto her: How now daughter? Is this the good entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you ſhew unto your knight, and the thanks you give him, for coming expreſly hither to ſerve you? I pray you call to mind, that he deſerveth a better countenance, were it onely for his fathers ſake, to whom you are ſo much beholding. My lord (ſaid ſhe) that is the cauſe I am ſo much offended with him, for if he reſembled the knight with the gréen Sword as much in courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie as in countenance, he had not ſtayed ſo long to obay his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will, and to ſatisfie the requeſts that you and I have made unto him by <hi>Carmelle</hi> and others, as your Grace know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Before God (ſaid the Emperor) and ſay true: yet I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have bin perſwaded you would conceive diſpleaſure ſo long time, conſidering what he hath done, and the rich preſents he ſent to you. My Lord (ſaid ſhe) if he hath done any thing for me it was without my commandment, I had rather he had done leſs in thoſe things, and that he had bin more obedient to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will and mine. Madam (ſaid the Emperor to <hi>Urganda</hi>) you ſée in my daughter how great the choler of an angry woman is. My Lord (ſaid ſhe) ſhe hath reaſon ſo to do, for that <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> obaying his father, ought to confirm himſelf both to her will and yours. And having failed therein, all he ſaith that he hath done for her ſake, may be accounted nothing, although I am aſſured, that the remembrance of my Lady your daughter hath made him (being in fight) enter into ſuch danger, that it was moſt ſtrange how he could eſcape. Wherefore Madam (ſaid ſhe to <hi>Leonorine</hi>) he deſerveth pardon for the ſame, and ſo I pray you grant him. While <hi>Urganda</hi> ſpake, the Princeſs beheld <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandian</hi> with ſo great affection, that in a manner ſhe lived and died in him: and he for his part by her felt in what ſort love uſeth thoſe he holds in his power. Whereby ſhe continued a time without anſwering <hi>Urganda</hi> not for any evil will to her in uſing of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But in the end ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred her ſelf, and ſaid unto her: Madam, ſéeing it is your pleaſure that I remit his offence, I am content to do it, upon condition, that if he forget himſelf as he hath done heretofore,
<pb facs="tcp:57308:104"/>
you ſhall bear the puniſhment for him. With that ſhe took him by the hand, and made him riſe up, changing ſpéech, becauſe the Empreſs (that in the mean time talked with the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>) came thither, whereby <hi>Eſplandian</hi> was conſtrained to leave the Princeſs, and ſalute her. The Emperor all that while had given no entertainment to King <hi>Armato,</hi> as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him not, but when they ſhewed him which was he, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him and ſaid: My Lord and brother, I beſéech you par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my ignorance, in not entertaining you before this time, as not knowing you, but I will amend the fault when you think good. My Lord (ſaid <hi>Armato</hi>) I am now (as it pleaſeth fortune) in place where you may command me, yet I pray you call to mind who I was, and what I may be, and do for me as you would I ſhould do for you if your caſe were mine: Conſidering with your ſelf, that the like hard fortune may fall on you, and that it is no leſs vertue to intertain the vanquiſhed courteouſly then to overthrow the puiſſant enemy. With that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror led him into his pallace, the reſt following after him, and when they were in the Hall, he left them with the Empreſs to ſpeak unto <hi>Frandalo,</hi> and taking him aſide, ſaid unto him: <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalo,</hi> to let you know how well I do account of the great good ſervice you have done for me, I will that from henceforth you ſhal be my chief Standard Bearer, in which place I now eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh you.

                  <p>How <hi>Norandel</hi> and Queen <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> fell in love one of the other, and what conference they had together.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Emperor being among his Knights, making them all the charge and honor that he could deviſe. It happened that the princeſs <hi>Leonorine</hi> and Quéen <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> ſéeing the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Norandel</hi> together, called <hi>Carmelle,</hi> and asked her who they were. My Ladies (ſaid ſhe) you have ſéen him that hath the leaſt beard here before, (which is the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>) for he came hither with <hi>Frandalo,</hi> the other is <hi>Norandel</hi> king
<pb facs="tcp:57308:105"/>
                  <hi>Luiſarts</hi> Son, eſtéemed for one of the hardieſt Knights living on the earth. I pray you (ſaid the Princeſs) deſire them to come hither, that we may ſpeak with them. With that <hi>Carmelle</hi> called them unto her, and as they were before the two Princeſſes the more they beheld the excellency of their beauties, the more they marvelled at it, and not without cauſe, for next unto <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norine</hi> there could hardly be found in all <hi>Greece</hi> one that match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Queen <hi>Minoreſſe,</hi> eſpecially in comelineſs and good behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, but if ſhe had ſome perfection in her, nature had not forgotten her ſelf in forming the two Knights, eſpecially <hi>Norandel,</hi> who till that time had never felt the ſtings of love, no more had Quéen <hi>Minoreſſe.</hi> Nevertheleſs, that little thief ſurpriſed them ſo covertly, that he bound them both, making them cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives one to the other, in ſuch manner, that after many Queſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions and Anſwers propounded they drew themſelves apart, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King of <hi>Denmark</hi> talking with the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine,</hi> the Queen aſking <hi>Norandal</hi> what he thought of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princeſe. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam (ſaid he) although I have heard her eſtéemed for one of the goodlieſt Ladies in the world, yet did I never think her beauty had béen ſuch as now I ſée it is, althought you are little behind her in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> reſpect, whereby I might eſtéem my ſelf moſt happy if I had bin aſléep that day I enterpriſed to take my journey hither. Wherefore (ſaid the Quéen) have you had ſo ill entertainment in this Court? No Madam (ſaid he) but there is one hath ſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len that from me which I have moſt carefully kept during my life. The Quéen not knowing what he meant, was thereat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed, asking him what it was, and whither he knew the thief. I Madam (ſaid he) and it reſteth in you to do me juſtice, if it be your pleaſure: for you and none other have that whereof I ſpeak. In good faith (ſaid the Quéen) you ſhall pardon me, for I have nothing of yours that I can remember. Madam (ſaid <hi>Norandel</hi>) ſince the time I firſt did know what belonged to a man, I kept my liberty, not alienating it to any one: But coming hither (I had no ſooner ſet mine eye on you) but I found my ſelf of a fréeman a bondſlaue and captive to your Ladyſhips good favor: which I beſéech you afford me, in recompence of the liberty you now have taken from me. Truly fix knight (ſaid ſhe) you have at this preſent run too far aſtray, for if you beheld me
<pb facs="tcp:57308:105"/>
as you ſhould, you had not found me ſuch a one as you ſay, and would have bin twice adviſed to uſe ſuch ſpéeches as you do Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, I will not take them at your hands (being a ſtranger) in ſo evil part as mine honor doth require, and I think likewiſe you ſpeak far otherwiſe then you mean: which ſhe ſaid to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine him. Thereby to ſée if <hi>Norandels</hi> words were ſpoken from the heart, who hearing that overthwart anſwer, was much aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, but being moved with love, anſwered her and ſaid: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, pardon my boldneſs I beſéech you, but I ſwear unto you, by the faith of a Knight, that I have diſcovered the ſecret of my heart: and if you will not believe me at this time, I hope in time to come to do ſo much, that you ſhall well perceive what great deſire I have to be your Knight, if it will pleaſe you to grant me ſo much favor to accept me for the ſame. When Quéen <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> perceived him ſo earneſt, as that in uttering thoſe words ſhe ſhewed great affection, ſhe eſtéemed in her mind to have ſufficient argument that might perſwade her to believe his words, wherewith ſhe anſwered him and ſaid: My Lord <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randel,</hi> If you do as you promiſe, I well believe that you ſay: and for the accepting you to be my Knight, me thinketh I ſhould do wrong to refuſe ſo ſmall a favor to ſo courteous a gentleman as you are: wherefore I both grant it and deſire it of you. With that ſhe took a little ring (ſhe commonly wore) off from her finger, giving it unto him for a witneſs of their new confirmed ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: And had it not bin that the Emperor was ready to go to ſupper, they had no ſooner left talking, but the Empreſs went in, whereby Quéen <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> was conſtrained to follow after, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Melie</hi> and <hi>Carmelle</hi> with her, to whom ſhe did all honor and good entertainment ſhe could deviſe: Supper being done, and the tables uncovered, the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine</hi> that had ſéen <hi>Norandel</hi> and Quéen <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> talking with ſo great affection, doubted ſome feathers in the wind, wherefore taking her aſide, ſaid unto her: Couſin, I believe the knight that entertained you ſo long, told you ſome news out of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> or ſomething elſe that pleaſed you full well, I pray you fair Lady tell me what it was, for you were very earneſt to harken thereunto. How now Madam? (ſaid ſhe) ſince when I pray you, did you learn to mock?
<pb facs="tcp:57308:106"/>
Call you that mocking (ſaid ſhe) which is done in earneſt? I pray God the mockery I mean to you, may fall out as I deſire it would, then ſhall I at the leaſt have as good advantage at you, as you have had at me, which would pleaſe me well, not ſo much to have a companion in mine own eſtate, as to yield you in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change the like pleaſure I have received at your hands, when you firſt were made acquainted with the love betwéen <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> and me. Wherefore fear not to utter your minde unto me, otherwiſe I will from henceforth have you in a jealouſie, for that you have already done, or yet would do. Madam (ſaid the Quéen) rather than you ſhould do ſo, I will declare to you the ſecreteſt thing I know. The Knight (ſaid ſhe) whereof you ſpeak (I know not by what means) hath ſo captivated my minde, that I féel the thing in my ſelf which I never thought would have happened unto me. And as they that are moleſted with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Ague, do finde the taſte of water better than the hope of life to them: ſo I likewiſe, that was accuſtomed not onely to contemn the force of Love, but blame all ſuch as yield to his might, (eſtéeming their eſtate rather voluntary than forcible) finde my ſelf ſo much ſurpriſed, that if God help me not, I am in the greateſt danger that ever poor woman was. What (ſaid the Princeſs) think you my Lord <hi>Norandel</hi> is of ſo hard a heart and little courteſie, as that he would diſdain the love of ſo fair and comely a Lady as you are? Do you perceive by him that his minde is placed elſewhere? No Madam (ſaid ſhe) but to the contrary, he proteſted to be wholly mine, without any further advantage, then that I have accepted him for my knight. Truly (ſaid <hi>Leonorine</hi>) I am glad thereof, and if you had done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, he might ſurely have complained, and you much more, to have refuſed ſo great a good, when it is offered without diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: elſe if it be otherwiſe, it is no good, but rather a curſe. I am of this opinion (ſaid ſhe) that my Lord <hi>Norandel</hi> would rather die a thouſand deaths than bear that minde: wherefore determine I pray you, to uſe him well, aſſuring you, that I will not fail to ſuccor you in what I may, and will do for you as you have done for me. So long they talked together, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and his company riſen from the Table, came to ſée the
<pb facs="tcp:57308:106"/>
Ladies. Nevertheleſs neither the Princeſs nor Quéen <hi>Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe</hi> could have the means to entertain their friends, but onely with a look, whereby (their hearts panting in their bellies) were ſomewhat eaſed: when night approached, every man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew him to his reſt, but when Quéen <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> found her ſelf alone, and in her bed, ſhe began to think upon the ſpéches that <hi>Norandel</hi> uſed unto her, ſometimes determining to aſſay, if by any means ſhe could drive the ſame out of her mind, and then preſently changed thoughts, and ſaid unto her ſelf: Alas, was there ever greater conſtancy in a woman, then that I always had until this time? Muſt I now of force yield up the fort, that againſt ſo many hard aſſaults I held invincible? Alas, I now perceive it is of force, wherefore it is better preſently to ſéek for remedy, then to conſume thus ſecretly as I do. Alas what? If I chance in this ſort to yield unto mine own deſire, (poor ſoul that I am) then do I manifeſtly perceive the danger wherein I fall, and the thraldom that I bring my ſelf into, from whence whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore it were far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for me to bridle mine own affection, and command that which commandeth me, then do that which hereafter I might repent. With that ſhe held her peace, and turning on each ſide, like one not well at eaſe in body nor in mind, ſhe had no ſooner reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved one thing, but preſently diſſolved it again, ſo great was her inconſtancy therein. Nevertheleſs, having well debated with her ſelf all the pleaſures or diſpleaſures that might chance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: In the end, with a loud voice ſhe uttered theſe words: I know not what may come to paſs, but Love promiſeth me great things: Wherefore if the worſt fal out, and that from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth I forget my ſelf, he ſhall bear the blame, and not I, that will do nothing but under his protection: In which opinion, ſhe fell a ſléep, and the next day <hi>Norandel</hi> and ſhe finding means to talk together, they confirmed their love in ſuch ſort, that they determined to uſe the ſame more by wiſdom, then by paſſion: which thoſe that are in like caſe, ought to follow, thereby to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto the point of their deſired joys, which in times paſt before, was commonly called the gracious gifts of Mercy.</p>

               <p>YOu heard before how <hi>Carmelle</hi> in her ſhip, ſhewed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror the tomb that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> had conquered in the Rock of the Enchantreſs with the Image of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie he held within his hand, which the Emperor remembred ſo well, that he never ceaſed to think thereon. Whereby, the next day after the arrival of that noble company in the City of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> he calling to mind that there could no perſon be found in all the world better able to reſolve his doubt, then <hi>Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda</hi> was, cauſed her to go into the cloſet, where the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs with the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine,</hi> Quéen <hi>Minoreſſe,</hi> and no more, ſtayed for her: they five being together, the Emperor cauſed the Image of <hi>Jupiter</hi> to be brought thither: which done, he ſaid unto <hi>Urganda:</hi> Madam, I pray you do me ſo much pleaſure as to declare (if it be poſſible) what are the meaning of the Letters that this Image holdeth. With that <hi>Urganda</hi> read it, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conſidered thereof, ſhe ſaid unto the Emperor: My Lord, the great knowledge and skill that this Idol hath foreſhowen ſhall in time to come be loſt, is already happened: for as you know, the power of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and of other gods, hath béen ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and aboliſhed by the coming of Ieſus Chriſt: and as touching theſe words, The bondſlave of the bond of ſlavery ſhall be burried here, and life reſtored by him that ſuffered death.

Prophecy was written concerning <hi>Matroco</hi> Lord of the Caſtle of <hi>the defended mountain,</hi> who as you know was always a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan till his latter day that he became a Chriſtian, whereby long time he continued a bond-ſlave of the bond of ſlavery: for ſuch ought the Sect of Idolatry to be named: but <hi>Eſplandian</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his repentance, ſuffered him to be buried in the hermitage, where as yet <hi>Carmelles</hi> father doth remain, who ſince that time hath ſo much honored the Giants body, that ſhe hath buried his bones within the Cedar Cheſt, that you Madam (ſaid ſhe to <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norine</hi>) if you do remember, gave unto her: And touching theſe lines which contain theſe words, <hi>That life ſhall be reſtored by him that ſuffered death:</hi> that is likewiſe to be underſtood of him, for that looſing this tranſitory life, he hath obtained the eternal in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom: ſo great grace hath he receiv'd at the hands of God by the merit of his Sons paſsion, in whom he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, as I ſaid before: and ſo my Lord (ſaid ſhe) you have heard what I can ſay as touching this ſtrange Prophecy. Ey but (ſaid the Emperor) what means the reſt? My Lord (ſaid ſhe) I can tell you no more of it than can my Lady your daughter, or Quéen <hi>Minoreſſe,</hi> but ſo much I can aſſure you, that in ſhort time you ſhall ſée it come to paſs: and if in any point it concerneth you, the beſt is it will all fall out to greater good of your ſoul, than to any power or worldly glory: wherewith for this preſent I pray you content your ſelf. I truly (ſaid the Emperor) and ſo will I always do: for ſo my ſoul be well, I eſtéem not the miſery or torments of my body. And with that he left <hi>Urganda</hi> with the Empreſs, &amp; went into the Hall, where great number of Knights and Gentlemen ſtayed for him: with whom he paſſed the reſt of the day in all pleaſant delights: mean time fortune by little and little began to play her part, and to ſpread the nets wherewith ſhe meant to incloſe that troop, thereby to work the envy and great tribulations that afterward fell upon them: the beginning whereof was ſuch as you ſhall hear.</p>

mans delight, whither he meant to lead the Ladies, with <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandian</hi> and his company, as alſo king <hi>Armato,</hi> to feaſt them in the ſame, and for that purpoſe within thrée days after their arrival, they departed from the City of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and went to <hi>Vaelbeniatnof,</hi> going into the park, wherein they found the hunters, and at their firſt entrance a great Hart was ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out, which in the end after long chace was killed almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ladies: and going further, they eſpyed a Bore ſo fiercely hunted by dogs, that they made him turn, and with his Tusks ſtroke the dogs, that none durſt ſet upon him: but at the laſt one of the hunters ſtrake him in the throat, and ſo he died: ſo long this ſport endured, that ſupper time drew on, wherefore the Lords and Ladies entring into the pallace found the tables covered, and ſitting down, were ſerved in moſt ſumptuous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: and having ſupped, they began to dance, which continued till midnight, minding the next day to begin their ſport again: but fortune minding to bear a part, did ſo trouble the feaſt that ſhe gave them well to underſtand, how ſhe can work in all things at her pleaſure: for the next day about evening the Knights and Ladies being in the Park, ſome talking with thoſe to whom they bare affections, and contenting their mind with ſuch devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as love to paſs the time in pleaſure, put into their heads, others running about and taking pleaſure to gather flowers, and do as moſt delighted them. <hi>Melie</hi> (from whom till then they could not hear one word) went unto <hi>Urganda,</hi> and before them all ſpake unto her and ſaid: Madam, I marvel (if it be ſo that your learning and skill be ſuch as is reported) why you make no ſport unto this company. <hi>Melie</hi> (ſaid <hi>Urganda</hi>) where you are preſent I will not undertake to do it before you, but you ſhould rather do it, being well aſſured, that the Emperor would be thankful for the ſame. If it pleaſeth him (ſaid ſhe) I am content, upon condition, that after me you do the like, or better if you can. Truly (ſaid the Emperor) it is but reaſon: and I pray you both to do it. My Lord (ſaid <hi>Melie</hi>) then command <hi>Urganda</hi> to lend me a book that I was wont to have, whereon the picture of <hi>Medea,</hi> (and her name written over it) doth ſtand, then ſhall you behold ſome of mine art, and if <hi>Urganda</hi> never knew it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb facs="tcp:57308:108"/>
ſhe may learn it now of me. In good faith (ſaid <hi>Urganda</hi>) that will I not deny you: with that ſhe called one of her Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen, willing her to fetch the book: mean time <hi>Melie</hi> took King <hi>Armato</hi> by the hand, and making as though ſhe would ſpeak a word with him, they walked a while together, then they ſat them down hard by the place where the Empreſs and the Ladies were talking with each other, and ſtaying till the thing <hi>Melie</hi> had requeſted, were brought unto her, ſhe having it in her hand opened the book, and then began to read, making certain ſigns with her eyes lifted up to heaven and calling <hi>Urganda,</hi> prayed her to come thither, ſaying ſhe ſhould ſée that ſhe never had ſéen before. <hi>Urganda</hi> not doubting any treaſon by <hi>Melie</hi> prepared, went and ſat down by her, and next her King <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> ſo that ſhe ſat betwéen <hi>Melie</hi> and him, where <hi>Melie</hi> began to turn the book, ſhewing them certain propheſies, and other ſtrange deviſes, which continued not long but the air began to be covered with a round black cloud, and therewith it ſéemed ſo dark, that they could not ſée each other, at the laſt the cloud o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and they beheld two horrible Dragons coming down out of the cloud that drew a waggon, and ſtayed right before <hi>Urganda,</hi> who by <hi>Armato</hi> and <hi>Melie</hi> was ſo ſtraitly embraced, that whither ſhe would or not they thruſt her in, and they after her. Wherewith the Dragons ſéeing their waggon charged, flew up into the air, and carried them away, <hi>Urganda</hi> crying for help, but all in vain: for in leſs than the twinckling of an eye ſhe was out of ſight: wherewith there was ſuch a noiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the company, that <hi>Eſplandian, Talanque, Ambor, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> and the reſt of the Knights that came thither with her, ſwear never to reſt above one night in a place before they found her out: ſo that the ſame day taking their leaves, both of the Emperor and others, that by them were left in ſorrow, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred again into the great Serpent, but before <hi>Eſplandian</hi> went, he ſpake unto the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine,</hi> beſéeching her not to take in evil part his enterpriſe taken in hand for the love of her, to whom he found himſelf ſo much beholding, promiſing her that preſently (having found <hi>Urganda</hi>) he would return again. My good friend (ſaid ſhe) me thinkes you ſhould do this at bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:57308:109"/>
leiſure, and not in ſo great haſte as now you do: yet am I well content to do as pleaſeth you: but forget not I pray you (ſaid ſhe) to return again as you have promiſed. Which <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> vowed upon his faith: mean time <hi>Norandel</hi> and Quéen <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> (as much grieved as might be) knew not what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to hold, having their hearts ſo ſeized with care, that the Quéen was conſtrained to withdraw her ſelf into her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and lay upon her bed, ſhutting the door: whereby <hi>Norandel</hi> had no meanes to take his leave, but imbarqued himſelf, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with an infinite number of griefes and ſorrowes: with that the great Serpent began of it ſelf to ſet forward, and within two days after arrived at the Caſtle of <hi>the defended mountain.</hi>

King <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mato</hi> was excéeding glad when he perceived himſelf to be in place whereas he might command, and went unto his pallace, where finding the guard, he made himſelf known unto them, they preſently went to advertiſe the Prince <hi>Alphorax,</hi> who much abaſhed at thoſe news, ſtart out of his bed, and caſting a furred gown upon his ſhouldiers, ran to imbrace his father, who ſéemed to be ſo changed, not onely becauſe his beard was longer than he uſed, but by reaſon of the great grief and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly he had ſo long endured, that the Prince began to wéep, and ſay unto him: My Lord, you are more than heartily wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, for Gods cauſe I beſéech you tell us how fortune hath béen ſo much your friend to deliver you out of the miſery wherein you have continued ſo long, to my no little grief.

But although that ſentence might well abaſh <hi>Urganda,</hi> yet ſhe ſhewed ſuch conſtancy, that ſhe never changed colour, determining with her ſelf to indure whatſoever ſhould fall out, wherefore ſhe ſaid unto <hi>Melie:</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, you may do with me as pleaſeth you, but in reaſon you ought not to uſe me otherwiſe then you your ſelf were uſed when I had the like authority over you, as you have now of me, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you ſhall do wrong both to your ſelf and me: To me, that am old and ancient, putting me in priſon, wherewith you threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten me, (not having offended you,) and to your ſelf, in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring cruelty before the courteſie that hath bin found in you: where to <hi>Melie</hi> anſwered her not a word, but commanded her to be ſhut into a great tower ſtanding in the midſt of thy City, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the which ſhe wrought ſuch conjurations, that <hi>Urganda</hi> knew without Gods help, it would be impoſſible for her ever to come forth: yet ſhe lived in hope, conſidering the mutability of fortune, and the King <hi>Armato</hi> himſelf had ben caſually delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, who continued certain days in his great City of <hi>Teſifant,</hi> without making any ſhew to be revenged.

               <p>Theſe Letters written and the Meſſengers diſpatched, they made ſuch haſte, that before the end of <hi>July</hi> following there were ſo many men aſſembled at the port of <hi>Tenedos,</hi> that the Chriſtians had news thereof, as hereafter you ſhall hear. One day among the reſt as <hi>Belleris, Talanque,</hi> and <hi>Manley</hi> being iſſued out of the Caſtle of <hi>the defended mountain,</hi> hoping to take ſome Turk in the way to <hi>Teſifant</hi> that might tell them news, not onely of the King <hi>Armato,</hi> but of <hi>Melie</hi> and <hi>Urganda,</hi> as day began to appear they came unto the adventurous fountain, where they beheld the pillars of braſs, the pavillion, and the field-bed that <hi>Heliaxe</hi> had left there, with a great Serpent lying therein, which preſently began to run away, and the Knights after, thinking to kill her, but their horſes durſt not go néer her, yet ſhe began to complain and wéep as bitterly as a woman tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling with childe. Wherewith there appeared four men well mounted and armed at all points, that cryed out and ſaid: Sir Knights, depart from hence and trouble not our gentlewoman in this ſort, or it ſhall coſt you your lives. And ſcarce had they ended their ſpéech, but they ran each at other, the ſtrange knights breaking their ſpears in ſuch manner upon the Chriſtians, that <hi>Manley</hi> and his companions thought they had run againſt them with long ſtrawes. Yet could not one of them couch his launce, but ran their courſe without once touching them. Mean time, the Serpent entred into a hole, and could no more be ſéen, and as they turned their horſes to run another courſe, the four Knights would not abide, but flying away, cryed unto them and ſaid: Sir Knights, our Gentlewoman is ſafe, for the reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent your ſelves if you think good. Get you hence to all the devils (ſaid <hi>Talanque</hi>) and ill fortune might he have that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
<pb facs="tcp:57308:111"/>
after you. With that they thrée returned unto the fountain, not without great laughing at their adventure. And as they were before the pavillion, they perceived a Knight that watered his horſe, to whom <hi>Belleris</hi> riding, asked him his name: What have you to do therewith? (ſaid he.) So much (ſaid <hi>Belleris</hi>) that either you ſhall tell me preſently with good will, or elſe ſhall fight with me. You ſhall fail in the one, but not in the other: for although you be thrée, yet am I well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to prove what the Knights of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> can do. When <hi>Talanque</hi> heard him ſpeak ſo boldly, he could not refrain to ſay: By God Sir Knight, that you ſhall prove without delay, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſpurs to his horſe, ran fiercely againſt the other that refuſed him not, but ſtrake him ſo ſure, that he overthrew him to the ground. Which <hi>Manley</hi> wondring at, ſet forward to revenge his friend: but if the firſt ſped ill, he ſped no better, no more did <hi>Belleris:</hi> all thrée riſing up again, aſhamed at their falls, which minding to amend by dent of Swords, the other Knight fled along the wood, crying ſo loud, that they might hear him ſay: Sir Knights, another time ſit better on your horſes, and trouble not your ſelves to follow me, if you mean not to loſe your way. In Gods name (ſaid <hi>Talanque</hi>) what may this mean, ſhall we have no better fortune all this day, I think we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted. Let us mount upon our horſes and follow after him, that we may know whether God or all the devils in hell have determined to croſs us in this journey. Wherewith they moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, determining to follow after the other, but they heard a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable voice, wherefore they ſtayed to ſée what it might be. With that they eſpyed a woman with her head undreſt, crying out for help: And after her ran a Lion ready to devour her: whereat they being moved with compaſſion, thought to ſtep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéen them, but the Lion began ſo horribly to rore, that the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſtricken with fear, bare their maſters above two long bows ſhot from thence: mean time, the woman and the Lion vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, whereat <hi>Talanque</hi> and <hi>Manley</hi> more abaſhed then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, asked <hi>Belleris</hi> if ever he heard of ſuch adventures. In good faith (ſaid he) thoſe that are deſirous to ſée ſtrange things, muſt repair unto this fountain: For there are many (and ſuch as yet

That ſhall be at another time (ſaid <hi>Belleris:</hi>) let us now kéep on our way, that we be not diſcovered. With that they held on the left hand, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways riding toward the City of <hi>Teſifant:</hi> and having ridden about five miles ſpace, they met ten men on horſeback all unar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, leading two Gentlewomen, one of them being ſomewhat fair and well aparelled. But the ten men were in ſo great fear, that leaving the Gentlewomen, they ran and ſaved themſelves not being purſued, for the thrée knights ſtayed with the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, of whom they hoped to hear ſuch news as they deſired. And in effect, after they had ſomewhat aſſured them, ther asked them what news of king <hi>Armato,</hi> and whether he were ſtill pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner. My Lords (ſaid the eldeſt Gentlewoman) it is not long ſince he eſcaped out of the Chriſtians hands, and is returned to <hi>Teſifant</hi> with <hi>Melie,</hi> that hath ſhut <hi>Urganda</hi> in a Tower, from whence ſhe ſhall never depart without her leave. That is good news for us then (ſaid <hi>Belleris:</hi>) and what hath king <hi>Armato</hi> done ſince his return? Doth he not (ſaid he) mean to be revenged on them that kept him priſoner ſo long? I truly (ſaid ſhe) for all the Kings, Souldans, Cailiffs, and Admirals of the Pagan Law, have promiſed him to arrive at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and to deſtroy all Chriſtendom. And as it is ſaid, the moſt part of them are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy arrived in the Iſle of <hi>Tenedos.</hi> In good faith (ſaid <hi>Belleris</hi> to his companions) conſidering the ſpéeches of theſe gentlewomen, I am of this opinion, that we meddle no longer with them, but return unto our hold. Whereunto they both agréed, and letting the Gentlewoman depart, made ſo great haſte, that about two hours after ſun-ſetting, they arrived at the Caſtle of <hi>the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded mountain,</hi> where they ſhewed their companions what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures they ſound in the <hi>adventurous Fountain.</hi> And at our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture (ſaid they) we found ten men on horſeback leading two Gentlewomen, by whom we have for certain underſtood, that
<pb facs="tcp:57308:112"/>
                  <hi>Urganda</hi> is ſtraightly ſhut-up in one of the Towers of <hi>Teſifant,</hi> and ſo inchanted therein by <hi>Melies</hi> conjurations, that ſhe is like never to come forth, as alſo that the Pagan Kings aſſemble themſelves together in the Iſle of <hi>Tenedos,</hi> to over-run the Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and all the Chriſtians country.</p>

Which words when <hi>Norandel</hi> had uttered, the tears trickled down his cheeks. Whereat Quéen <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> took ſuch pity, that forgetting her diſſimulation, with a ſmiling countenance ſhe anſwered him and ſaid: My good friend, I now believe you well, and therefore I pray you pardon my indiſcretion: for ſo it is, that this that I have done, hath been onely to avoid the means that ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure you to attempt the ſame. Now I well perceive your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy (according to my counſel at your laſt departure hence) remember I beſeech you how neceſſary diſſimulation is to ſuch as are infected with the like diſeaſe: I mean, it ſhould not be between us two, but before the world that they perceive it not.

Army all the Kings and Potentates of the Eaſt (enemies of our Faith) have lately raiſed, by the perſwaſion of <hi>Armato</hi> king of <hi>Turky,</hi> therewith to over-run not only the Empire of <hi>Greece,</hi> but all the Land of Chriſtendom, and wholly to extinguiſh our Faith and holy Law. And for that all thoſe of whom you hold the place, have always bin the true Defenders of the Chriſtian Faith, as alſo that the caſe toucheth you ſo néer, I am of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe (my lord) that you ought to ſpare neither mony nor men, but to aſſemble your Forces in all haſte, and prepare your Veſſels to aid and ſuccor the good Prince, who is the Frontier (as you know) both unto you, and all the Potentates that hold the Law of Chriſt.

With that the Emperor leaving <hi>Enil</hi> with King <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> went unto the Gentlemen and Knights that then were preſent, and ſaid unto them: My friends, we muſt all to the Wars: my Nephew <hi>Eſplandian</hi> hath advertiſed me (by this Gentleman expreſly ſent unto me) that the king of <hi>Turky</hi> and all his Allies are in arms, and have raiſed a mighty Army to aſſail my brother the Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> but I vow to God (if he give me life and help) that before the moneth of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> next enſuing, I will be there with ſuch a Force, that I will make him twice repent how he ſo raſhly doth aſſail, and learn him to defend himſelf. Wherefore let every man be ready, for I will go my ſelf in perſon: And calling king <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> he asked him if he would go with him?

And to the end my lord (ſaid he) that order may be had to prevent the inconvenience he foreſéeth to be prepared againſt all Chriſtendom (if it be not ſuccored) he hath expreſly willed me to ſhew you, that he hath had certain intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that all the Kings of the Eaſt parts have ſworn and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed together to over-run all Chriſtendom: which is very likely, conſidering the great preparations &amp; aſſembly of men they have already made in the Iſle of <hi>Tenedos:</hi> which is ſuch, that as our ſpies report, they are at leaſt ſix hundred ſail of Ships, and about four or five hundred thouſand men. God will help us if it pleaſed him, ſaid the King <hi>Amadis,</hi> for my part, I will do what poſsible I may, and will likewiſe advertiſe King <hi>Perion</hi> my father, and my brother <hi>Galaor.</hi> My Lord (ſaid <hi>Gandalin</hi>) I have alſo charge to travel unto them, and likewiſe unto <hi>Gaſquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan, Don Brunean, Quedragant,</hi> and others, to whom <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> hath written in like ſort as he hath done to you, and hath expreſly given me in charge to ſée King <hi>Luiſart,</hi> and do his hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble commendations unto him. It is great reaſon (ſaid the king:) nevertheleſs I am of this opinion, that before my mother the Queen you do not once declare the occaſion of your coming, but give her to underſtand that all is well, but not unto the king, if you find him alone: for he is a man (as every one well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) to take all things with patience as they ſhall fall out: and becauſe my Sons affairs require no delay, I pray you <hi>Gandalin</hi> after you have refreſhed your ſelf a day or two, go on your jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney as you have in charge. So <hi>Gandalin</hi> that day remained there, during which time Quéen <hi>Oriane</hi> talked long with him: the next day he departed to ſée King <hi>Luiſart</hi> and Quéen <hi>Briſanne</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:57308:115"/>
at <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> who knowing he came of meſſage from <hi>Eſplandian</hi> were excéeding glad: the Quéen, although ſhe were wiſe and very aged, yet could not change her womans nature, but before the king ſpake any word asked him for her ſon: but <hi>Gandalin</hi> (accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed readily to deviſe excuſes, as he had béen inſtructed by King <hi>Amadis</hi>) told her that he had left him in the firm Iſle not well at eaſe by reaſon of his long travel, but not ſo ill (ſaid he) as that he could not have taken pain to come hither and ſée you, but he feared leſt his ſickneſs would encreaſe: where he thought it better for him to kéep his chamber a while, than to entertain a long and envious ague for a long ſpace: which the Quéen eaſily believed: and for the hope ſhe had ſhortly to ſée him, ſhe made no account thereof: nevertheleſs, the ſame evening <hi>Gandalin</hi> told King <hi>Luiſart</hi> all that you heard before, wiſely excuſing himſelf of the ſpéech he uſed before him unto the Quéen, as King <hi>Amadis</hi> had given him charge: wherein king <hi>Luiſart</hi> commended him, &amp; for the reſt he promiſed to think thereon while he travelled unto thoſe with whom he had to do. In this ſort <hi>Gandalin</hi> being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched, returned to king <hi>Amadis,</hi> who in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mean time (perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Quéen <hi>Oriane</hi>) wrought a marriage for him, as you ſhall hear. You have read in the beginning of our hiſtory of the ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the gentlewoman of <hi>Denmark</hi> did for them, and the things wherein ſhe &amp; <hi>Gandalin</hi> had béen exerciſed: wherefore it was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that having béen partakers of their youthful toys, ſhe ſhould alſo taſte ſome of their proſperous fortunes. Wherefore Quéen <hi>Oriane</hi> moved king <hi>Amadis</hi> to make a marriage betwéen them two, but he thought the match unfit, becauſe the gentlewoman was already aged, &amp; <hi>Gandalin</hi> being yong &amp; luſty: nevertheleſs,) as all women that are wiſe and of a quick conceit, can bring their enterpriſes to effect, the Quéen found means to get the kings conſent: wherby <hi>Gandalin</hi> was no ſooner come from <hi>Mire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleur,</hi> but he took him aſide, &amp; ſaid unto him: <hi>Gandalin,</hi> the quéen is deſirous to have you ſtay with us, not only for the love ſhe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth I bear unto you, but alſo for the good ſhe wiſheth you. And for this cauſe ſhe would have you marry with the gentlewoman of <hi>Denmark,</hi> whom ſhe loveth, and will do much both for her and you, if you conſent thereto: you know her long time ſince both to be wiſe, good, &amp; vertuous, and for my part I pray you and counſel
<pb facs="tcp:57308:116"/>
you thereunto. <hi>Gandalin</hi> would gladly have excuſed himſelf, and to ſay the truth, he was too yong for ſo old a match: nevertheleſs having from his infancy learned to confirm his will to that of <hi>Amadis,</hi> he was content to do as pleaſed him: in ſuch ſort, that in leſs than three days after the marriage was celebrated and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Mean time king <hi>Amadis</hi> took the letters and inſtructions that <hi>Gandalin</hi> ſhould carry to <hi>Gaſquillan</hi> and king <hi>Brunean,</hi> and ſent them by a gentleman of his named <hi>Handro,</hi> couſin german to the Counteſs of <hi>Flanders,</hi> deſiring them as much as poſſible they might, to aid his ſon in his ſo good a cauſe: but the next week following, <hi>Gandalin</hi> more affected to the ſervice of <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> than to court his wife, departed from thence to travel into <hi>France</hi> unto king <hi>Perion,</hi> and from him to <hi>Sobradiſe</hi> to <hi>Galaor.</hi> Mean time king <hi>Amadis</hi> ſent for all the Pilots, maſters, and marriners of his country that he could find, commending King <hi>Arban</hi> of <hi>Norgales,</hi> to take care for all things requiſite for the enterpriſe and charges of ſuch a voyage, both for men and veſſels. In this manner did the affairs touching theſe wars proceed through the greateſt part of <hi>Europe</hi> while al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings in the Eaſt by little &amp; little aſſembled themſelves together, as you ſhall hear.</p>

                  <p>How the great City of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was beſieged by the Princes of the Eaſt, and of the ſallies that were made by thoſe of the City to keep them from the ſame.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe army of the Pagan Kings daily aſſembling in the Iſle of <hi>Tenedos,</hi> the Emperor mean time fortified his city of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> both with men and victuals in the beſt manner he could, commanding thoſe that had charge of his army by Sea to cauſe all his veſſels to come into the Haven of the Town, which he cauſed to be barred with a chain, that on that ſide he might be cut of danger. Then he ſent divers brigandines unto <hi>Natolia,</hi> to diſcover the Pagans army, and bring him certain news: Mean time, the country people reaped all their corn, and brought it to the City. Within eight days after the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandines that were ſent forth, diſcovered in the ſtraights of <hi>Helleſpont</hi> the great Fléet of the Turks that lay at <hi>Abidos,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:57308:116"/>
where they ſtayed a certain time to take in victuals and other munitions neceſſary for their ſhips. Whereof the Emperor being advertiſed, cauſed his men to muſter, giving <hi>Frandalo</hi> charge of the Dragon-gate, ſo called, becauſe that at the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the city, when it was named <hi>Briſance,</hi> there was found a marvellous Dragon under the foundation of the gate, which Dragon was bound, chained, and nouriſhed ſo long time, that it was thought moſt ſtrange. <hi>Norandel</hi> had charge of the Gate called <hi>Equiline,</hi> and <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> his nephew of that called <hi>The Well,</hi> ſo named of a great and profound well that ſtood hard by it. And cauſing the other gates to be rampired up, provided for all things as a wiſe and valiant captain ſhould do in ſuch a caſe. With that a Grecian that had bin taken by the Turks, came into the City, and aſſured them for certain that the Souldan of Liquie was himſelf in perſon with king <hi>Armato,</hi> and almoſt all the Kings of the eaſt, having two hundred Gallies, as well great as ſmall, fifty great ſhips, thirty mahomes, and one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty caf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rds, that are thips not much unlike to gallies: beſides thirty foiſtes and divers brigandines, barques, galions and ſciffs, where in they had laid their victuals and other munitions: and for their number of footmen, they might be about ſome thrée hundred and fifty thouſand men: ſaying likewiſe, that <hi>Alpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax</hi> had the chief charge at Sea, and <hi>Armato</hi> on land, and that their determination was never to depart from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> till they had deſtroyed it, and from thence would go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and further if they could. The ſixt day after, this great Army (paſſing the gulf of <hi>Propontide</hi>) came into the ſtraights of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> entring in the great ſea, where they remained du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſiege, robbing al the country about, where firſt they ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a wéek before they landed any of their men: mean time, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain gallies and ſmall ſhips ſet forward to make an alarum in the haven, from whence (to their great loſs) they were repulſed, for that ſix of the principalleſt of them were ſunk in the Sea. Nevertheleſs, the next day following they began to land, and in great numbers thought to win the gate: thers were many brave blows both with Sword and Spear given on both parts, and many a valiant man ended their days, and became meat to

                  </gap>ught. But what ſhould I ſtand longer to deſcribe this conflict? To conclude, the gate was defended, and the enemies repulſed from the ſame, yet their number was ſo great, that notwithſtanding the valor of the Emperors men they landed and lay within two bows ſhot of the City, they of the City being forced to retire. The Pagans being on land, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided themſelves into four parts, in ſuch ſort, that the City was ſo well beſieged, that not a man could enter or come forth without their leave. Wherefore King <hi>Armato</hi> preſently cauſed great number of ladders to be prepared, the moſt part of them double, hoping before the wéek were ended, to aſſault, take, ſpoil, and deſtroy the City. But they within ſlept neither night nor day, but made artificial fires, with all other things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for ſuch a charge. The Pagans ſtayed not long to execute their purpoſe, ſo that upon a munday in the morning, they came in great fury to ſet fire on the gates, and to ſeale the Town, although for that time they loſt their labors, and many of them their lives, where in the end they were conſtrained to retire to their no little ſhame and great confuſion. And in their retreat, <hi>Norandel</hi> with four or five hundred men iſſued at a poſtern-gate, and ſet upon them behind, which put them in ſuch fear, that they drave them to their tents. Yet not being content with this firſt repulſe, they determined on Friday after either to die, or enter into the town. And the day appointed, ran unto the walls, where the number of the aſſailants was ſo great, and the aſſault given in ſo many places both by ſea and land, that if God had not provided for them, it is moſt certain the town had béen ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: eſpecially on <hi>Frandalos</hi> ſide, for the moſt part of his men fled away from their guard: whereby it happened, that more then a hundred Turks mounted on the walls, but they ſtayed not long, for that the Emperor (who during the aſſault ſtayed in the midſt of the City with the reſt of all his power to aid ſuch places as had moſt néed) advertiſed thereof, marched to <hi>Frandalos</hi> quarter,
<pb facs="tcp:57308:117"/>
and with ſuch force repulſed the enemy, that he made them glad to get them thence, in ſuch ſort, that they received no leſs loſs at the ſecond aſſault, then at the firſt. It is true, that ten of the Knights of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> were ſlain at the conflict, which much grieved their companions, eſpecially for the loſs of <hi>Ledarin,</hi> of <hi>Feiarque,</hi> of <hi>Trys,</hi> and <hi>Imoſil</hi> of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> This ſecond aſſault having had ſuch iſſue as you heard before, <hi>Armato</hi> went to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel with al the other kings and princes to know what they ſhould do, where it was concluded to kéep their tents, and ſo incloſe the town: for to get it by aſſault, they knew full well they ſhould but l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if it pleaſeth you to beſtow ſome favor upon me, that I might bear the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my Armor, I ſhould account my ſelf for one of the moſt happy Knights living on the earth.

If therefore it be ſo, the ſtrength procéedeth from him, be you then well aſſured, that he will impart ſo much to you as you ſhall want. Madam (ſaid <hi>Talanque</hi>) at other times we have béen at the like feaſt, from whence we have returned to the great expence of thoſe that called us thither: as (if it be Gods will) we hope this day to do the like. Wherewith taking
<pb facs="tcp:57308:119"/>
their leaves of her, they went to finde their horſes, and being mounted, the Emperor with great number of Knights and Gentlewomen brought them to the gate: And committing them to God, the ten Knights marched bravely to the place of Combat, where the Souldan with a great number of his friends met them, aſking them whom the Emperor had appointed Iudge on their ſide. Souldan (ſaid <hi>Norandel</hi>) we deſire no other Iudge then your ſelf, that are accounted a courteous and moſt faithful Prince. By all my gods (ſaid he) I had rather die a thouſand deaths, then you ſhould endure the leaſt injury in the world: we believe it well (ſaid all the knights) With that he cauſed them to enter into the Liſts at one end, and the ten Pagans at the other: but before they entred into fight, he called <hi>Norandel</hi> and his companions, and ſaid unto them: My friends, I pray you let me ſhew you what the cuſtom of my Countrey is in ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs: then if you think good, you may obſerve it; if not, my knights ſhall kéep your cuſtom if it be indifferent. Shew us then (ſaid <hi>Norandel</hi>) what it is, and if the ſame be reaſonable, we will not refuſe it. You ſhall underſtand (ſaid he) that all knights juſtle one againſt one, to the end that all men may know the excellency of the Victor: And if any one be overthrown, he that is on the horſe back ſhall not aſſail the other before their companions have run out their courſe: Then he that is on horſeback ſhall a light, and ſhall fight it out by dint of ſword with him that before was overthrown.

<pb facs="tcp:57308:120"/>
Pagan fell over his horſe tail, lying flat upon the ground: but <hi>Norandel</hi> had no hurt, onely that his horſes ſhoulder was thruſt out of joint, ſo that he lighted off, ſtaying till the reſt had run their courſes, as he had promiſed. Then <hi>Garvate du Val Crain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tif</hi> ran againſt one of the other, and they charged each other in ſuch ſort, that their féet failing in their ſtirrops, they were both caſt out of their ſaddles. Then <hi>Talanque</hi> ran againſt the third Pagan, to whom fortune was more favorable then to any of the reſt: for they ran ſo well, that neither of them once ſtarted aſide, or moved in their ſaddles, and yet brake their ſpears in many pieces. The like chanced to <hi>Manley</hi> and <hi>Ambor,</hi> but not to <hi>Bravor</hi> the ſon of <hi>Balan,</hi> for he hit him that ran againſt him right in the breaſt, and threw him from his horſe. And preſently therewith <hi>Imoſil</hi> of <hi>Burgundy</hi> had ſo great a ſtroke with a launce that his eyes ſtarted in his head, and was therewith ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed, that his horſe bare him to the ſide of the barriers, where he fell down flat. <hi>Elian le delibere,</hi> and he that ran againſt him, were conſtrained to hold by their horſes mains. <hi>Liſtoran</hi> of the bridge miſſed his ſtroke, and his enemy likewiſe: the like hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to <hi>Trion,</hi> and the laſt that ran with him. That done, all they that were on horſe back, lighted down to fight with ſwords, and there began betwéen them ſuch a fight as the like had not béen ſéen of ſo few Knights together, maintaining themſelves ſo brabely one againſt the other, that the ſtrongeſt of them was ſo weary and out of breath, that they were conſtrained to reſt. And as <hi>Norandel</hi> leaned upon his Sword which he reſted on the ground, the bracelet that <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> gave him fell downward upon his arm, which put him in ſo good remembrance of her, that clean forgetting all the travel he had taken before, he ſpake ſo loud that every man might hear, and ſaid: By God, ſir Knight, this reſt doth not beſéem us: many men will from henceforth be in doubt of the great glory that now we mean to win. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let every man ſhew forth what we can do, and let no man ſpare. Wherewith taking the little piece of his ſhield that reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his hand, and lifting up his arm, he gave ſo great a blow unto his enemy, that he made him réel therewith: and doubling it ſtrake him ſo ſurely on the helmet, that with the blow the
<pb facs="tcp:57308:120"/>
Turk was forced to knéel down, and let his ſword fall out of his hand: which <hi>Norandel</hi> ſeized upon being ready to ſtrike off his head, if he had not cried him mercy: which <hi>Talanque</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> perceiving, imployed their forces in ſuch manner, that it might eaſily be judged they would ſoon obtain the victory. As for <hi>Bravor</hi> he had already ſtricken his knight down, wherefore he ran to help the reſt, and <hi>Norandel</hi> likewiſe. With the which help it ſoon appeared, that they which reſted yet to overcome would not long reſiſt: for in ſhort ſpace they found themſelves in ſuch extremity, that unleſs the Souldan of <hi>Liquie</hi> had deſired the Chriſtian Knights to ſtay a while, they had all died: but calling <hi>Norandel</hi> unto him, he ſaid: I pray you (ſaid qe) procéed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this combate, and content your ſelves that I account my Knights for vanquiſhed, as in truth they are, and ſo hardly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that the force you ſhall from henceforth uſe againſt them, ſhall more be holden for a kinde of cruelty than any chivalry. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs if my requeſt may take no place with you, do as you think good. Souldan (ſaid <hi>Norandel</hi>) if they acknowledge it at our hands and ask us mercy, they ſhall not fail to have it: for it was never our cuſtom to uſe force to ſuch as could not ſtand againſt us. Content your ſelves (ſaid he) that I that am their Lord yield you the victory, and I pray you therefore ſhew mercy unto them, ſwearing unto you by my crown (if you do them ſo much good) that while I live, I will not be unmindful of the ſame. With that the ten Chriſtian Knights went out of the field, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their horſes, took their way unto the City, where the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ſtayed for them, for he had ſéen the iſſue of the combate, and now they returned victors: but he heard not what words had paſt betwéen them, till they being lighted off their horſes, told him what was done, for the which he praiſed God, eſtéeming more of them for their courteſie they had ſhewen unto the enemy.</p>

To come unto the point, this quéen of <hi>Califorine</hi> being a woman of great ſpirit, valiant, hardy, yong, fair, and of good behavior, hearing of the wars underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt the Chriſtians, was deſirous to be there, not for any ill ſhe wiſhed them, but onely for to know them, and to ſée their country that bare ſo great renown.

ſhewing them what honor they might obtain in that voyage: which may peradventure be ſuch (ſaid ſhe) that by our force and great proweſs we may greatly augment our Empire, being fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and redoubted of each man, and not continue always buried among theſe mountains, as they in times paſt did, of whom at this preſent we now poſſeſs and injoy the place.

And the better to induce them thereunto, ſhe told them ſhe had fifty Griffons that would not fail (being let out of their cages) to ſeize upon the Chriſtians without hurting of her women, becauſe they knew them and had béen nouriſhed with them. And while they take their flight (ſaid ſhe) I will give ſuch an aſſault againſt the town, that without doubt we will inforce the ſame: for if the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors ſouldiers appear but to defend the walls; my Griffons ſhall be ready to carry them clean away, as the Merlin doth the Lard.

armed according to their manner (the moſt part of them bearing bows) ran with great fury unto the walls, and with their ladders began to mount up: with that the alarm went about the city, all men running to defend the ſame: and as they were ſome upon the walls and other places of defence, the Quéen made ſign to let the Griffons looſe, which being hungry and fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the town, ſeized upon ſuch as they could find abroad: wherewith the Emperors ſouldiers were in ſo great fear, that moſt part of them that fought, forſook the walls to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Alas what pity was it to ſée ſoldiers, citizens, knights, and others, yea women and little children, and all whatſoever they could get into their claws taken up into the air, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times having taken them up, they let them fall upon the ſtones, whereby they had a ſtrange and cruel death: ſurely if God had not kept the City better than thoſe that had the charge, it is moſt ſure it had been taken at that time. But there happened a ſtrange caſe, for as the Griffons held their prey, and that the Knights of great <hi>Brittain</hi> with ſome ſmall number of others, reſiſted the aſſault made by the women, the Turks (that had been advertiſed not to come out of their tents while they aſſailed the town) moved with too greedy a deſire to ſack the City which they thought ſurely had been taken, ran unto the aſſault making ſuch a noiſe, that the Griffons (feeding on their preys) left the bodies they had ſeized upon, and flying up again, ſeized on them that they ſaw come running to the town, whereof in ſhort ſpace after they made ſo great a butchery, that more than four hundred Turks were preſently ſlain by them: mean time thoſe within the town perceiving that good fortune, did ſo fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repulſe the <hi>Californiens,</hi> that their principal women lay dead within the ditches: wherewith the Queen was forced to retire, knowing her enterpriſe would not take effect as ſhe deſired it ſhould, not by reaſon of her ſouldiers, but in that they kept not in as they had promiſed. Wherewith ſhe commanded to take the birds again, but the Falconers could not by any means make them to come in, before they had ſlain and devoured above a thouſand Turks and others, whereof they onely ſuckt the blood. Wherewith King <hi>Armato</hi> and the Souldan of <hi>Liquie</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:57308:122"/>
were ſo grieved, that from thenceforth they began to ſhew ſo hard a countenance to the Queen, that ſhe was in the minde to return into her country, not offering from that time once to give ſtroke with ſword to their advantage. Yet not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe was appeaſed, and fought with King <hi>Amadis,</hi> as it ſhall be ſhewed you at large in the end of this our fifth Book. And that we may have the better means to attain thereto, we will now return again unto the Chriſtian Princes, that aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled their powers and forces to help the Emperor, imbarquing themſelves, as preſently you ſhall hear. But before they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> many good Knights both of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> and others were ſlain within the City, not onely in the aſſaults made againſt it by the Pagans, but at the laſt aſſault made by the Queen <hi>Calafre,</hi> among the which, none were ſo much lamented as <hi>Ledarin de Faiarque, Trys, Imoſil</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the two ſons of the Giant <hi>Balan.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>IF you have read the diſcourſe of this our Hiſtory, it hath been ſhewed you before, how <hi>Enil</hi> went unto the Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Floreſtan</hi> King of <hi>Sardaigne,</hi> and what became of <hi>Gandalin</hi> after he had paſſed the Straights of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> and entred in the Ocean Sea, even to <hi>Great Brittain</hi> and other places, where he found King <hi>Amadis</hi> and others, to whom he had charge to go: Now we muſt declare the reſt. You ſhall therefore underſtand, that <hi>Gandalin</hi> having ſojour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned eight days in <hi>London,</hi> more by the commandment of king <hi>Amadis</hi> and Queen <hi>Oriane,</hi> than for the pleaſure that he took in the woman they had cauſed him to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, knowing the affairs wherein he had left his companions, departed from thence, and travelled ſo long, that he arrived
<pb facs="tcp:57308:123"/>
in <hi>France,</hi> and went unto King <hi>Perion</hi> to whom he gave the letter that his ſon and grand-child ſent unto him: and withal declared the ſtate of the Eaſt countries, as they then were, with the inconvenience that might fall unto all Chriſtendom, if the Empire of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> were in obedience to the infidels. So well could <hi>Gandalin</hi> tell his tale, that the good old King <hi>Perion</hi> moved with a holy zeal, determined to go himſelf in perſon, and to take with him great quantity of ſhips and men, furniſhed for the wars. <hi>Gandalin</hi> ſtayed not long with them, but while he prepared himſelf, he went into <hi>Scotland, Norway, Sobradiſe, Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweathland,</hi> and did his Embaſſages ſo well, that all the Kings and Princes to whom he went, determined with all ſpéed to aid <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> in ſuch ſort, that in ſhort time after their ſhips were ready, and thoſe of <hi>Sweathland, Norway,</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> come unto the port of <hi>Suer,</hi> from whence ſetting ſail, they coaſted along <hi>Freſeland, Holland,</hi> and <hi>Braband,</hi> till they arrived at <hi>Bulloigne,</hi> where King <hi>Perion</hi> had prepared great number of Ships, Hulkes, and other veſſels: which being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with men, victuals, and munition neceſſary for the wars, hoiſed ſail and put to ſea. And coaſting <hi>Normandy,</hi> came to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Brittaigne</hi> where they ankered in <hi>S. Mathews</hi> Haven, where the Kings, <hi>Luiſart</hi> and <hi>Amadis</hi> accompanied of <hi>Grumedan</hi> and divers other Knights, were arrived to refreſh themſelves: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving paſſed the Iſle of <hi>Sorlingue,</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> men imbarqued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at the cape <hi>Antiquan,</hi> and the Scots at cape <hi>Balſo.</hi> And having ſailed the way that the <hi>Brittons</hi> had paſt, joyned with the Weſtern Princes that went that voyage, in ſuch ſort, that within thrée days after they ſet ſail, and having a Northeaſt winde, they diſcovered the coaſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> paſſing the Port of <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis terre in compoſtelle:</hi> after that the cape <hi>S.

<pb facs="tcp:57308:123"/>
certain of their Gallions could not follow the ſhips, but ſtayed behind to the number of eight, being ſo ſcattered, that they made account they had béen loſt. Nevertheleſs, the next day they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived all at Port S. <hi>Luce,</hi> where without longer ſtaying they paſſed forward to go to <hi>Regi,</hi> where the army of the Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> (coming from <hi>Oſty</hi>) lay at anker ſtaying for them. Where they continued ſix days, not onely to take in freſh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but alſo to calk and mend their ſhips and other veſſels that had need: the ſeventh day having a good wind, they hoyſed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and ſetting ſail, coaſted along the country of <hi>Morea,</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Cape de <hi>Malvaſie,</hi> where the winde fell ſomewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: but in the end the ſea waxing calm, put forward to Cape <hi>Calon,</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Negrepont:</hi> and entring into the <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelago</hi> they diſcovered the ſide of the Cape <hi>Athos,</hi> till they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached <hi>Galiopi,</hi> leaving the Ile of <hi>Tenedos,</hi> becauſe they would not be diſcovered by the Turks that <hi>Armato</hi> had ſet there to kéep a paſſage for his victuals to be brought unto the army: where they ſtayed not long but they entered into the goulfe of <hi>Propontide,</hi> coaſting <hi>Thrace,</hi> till they came unto the Port of <hi>Salombre,</hi> which is not above thirty miles from the City of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where they landed, that they might the better approach the Pagans camp: with that they agréed among them that King <hi>Childadan</hi> and <hi>Quedragant</hi> ſhould be Generals of the army by Sea: and having left ſufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men for the furniſhing and ſafe kéeping of their ſhips, their Fléet ſailed towards <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> hoping to ſet upon <hi>Alphorax</hi> and his army by Sea before they ſhould perceive them. But it fell out otherwiſe, for the Turks that had ſpies in all places, diſcovered them, not ſuffering <hi>Alphorax</hi> to fight, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him moſt earneſtly onely to kéep the entry of the ſtraits, to take all means from the town to be victualled on that ſide. Which King <hi>Childadan</hi> and <hi>Quedragant</hi> underſtanding, would not hazard themſelves, but ankered within half a mile of the enemy, ſtaying for king <hi>Luiſart,</hi> the Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thoſe that marched by land, mean time giving divers skirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes to the enemy with their Pinnaces, but <hi>Alphorax</hi> for all that would not leave his hole, lying as cloſe as poſsibly he could:
<pb facs="tcp:57308:124"/>
on the other ſide <hi>Armato</hi> and his company being advertiſed of the great aid that came towards the town, cauſed their forces to aſſemble, determining to kéep the ſide of the great ſea, by the which they might eaſilier recover victuals, as well from <hi>Nato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> as out of <hi>Tartaria.</hi> The Kings <hi>Amadis, Perion,</hi> and others made ſuch haſte, that the ninth day after they incamped them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the ſight of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> right before their enemies, in a place that ſéemed moſt convenient. But if the Pagans at the firſt were much abaſhed to ſée thoſe ſuccors, the Emperor and thoſe within the town were not much leſs, doubting it had béen ſome new forces come againſt the town: for they had not any intelligence of the ſending of <hi>Gandalin</hi> and <hi>Enil</hi> to the Chriſtian princes, that brought with them a multitude both of ſhips and men, as well Knights as others. Now to return to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Fléet: King <hi>Childadan</hi> knowing that <hi>Alphorax</hi> played the fox, deſired <hi>Quedragant</hi> (having equal power with him) to be content that he with threeſcore Pinnaces might skirmiſh with him, that thereby if it were poſsible, he might provoke him to come out, which he agréed unto: wherefore ſetting ſail, he made towards his enemy, ſo neer, that they were ready to fight hand to hand: nevertheleſs <hi>Alphorax</hi> for that time would not touch the bait, but entred farther in the ſtraights: wherewith King <hi>Childadan</hi> retired, and came unto the haven of the City, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the braveſt ſhow that might be ſéen: thoſe of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> perceiving the Handirols and Streamers of <hi>Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> and of other Chriſtian Princes, made him anſwer with the like, and ſo high, that the noiſe of the Trumpets, Clerons, and Tabers was ſo great, that <hi>Armato</hi> and all the Pagans might eaſily hear it. With that King <hi>Childa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> was received by the Emperor, <hi>Norandel,</hi> and others, to whom he ſhewed what aid was come unto them, and what princes had taken the voyage in hand. In good faith (ſaid the Emperor) they bind me for ever unto them, yet am I much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed how they underſtood of the wars between <hi>Armato</hi> and me. What? my Lord (ſaid <hi>Childadan</hi>) did <hi>Eſplandian</hi> never tell you thereof? No I aſſure you (ſaid the Emperor) nor any of his companions, as far as I know. Is he not in the City (ſaid the
<pb facs="tcp:57308:124"/>
King?) In good truth (ſaid <hi>Norandel</hi>) he would not leave the caſtle of <hi>the defended mountain,</hi> minding to keep it, if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans came to beſiege it. Aſſure your ſelves (ſaid <hi>Childadan</hi>) he will not long ſtay there before King <hi>Amadis</hi> ſendeth for him: for we determine preſently to give battel, and if he ſhould fail at ſuch a journey, it would grieve him ever after. Much other talk had the Knights of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with <hi>Childadan</hi> and thoſe that bare him company, where he ſtayed till the next day in the morning, that he entered into his ſhips to return unto <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragant.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>KIng <hi>Childadan</hi> returned to <hi>Quedragant</hi> as you heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the army on land incamped in fight of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, <hi>Amadis</hi> was advertiſed by thoſe that had bin in the City of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> were at the Caſtle of <hi>the defended mountain,</hi> whereupon he ſent <hi>Gandalin</hi> to fetch them, <hi>Gandalin</hi> took ſhipping, and had ſo good a winde, that without any adventure he arrived there, where he declared unto them how King <hi>Amadis</hi> and almoſt all the Chriſtian Princes were incamped within half a mile of the Pagans hoſt, and al what he and <hi>Enil</hi> had done concerning their charge. And becauſe (ſaid <hi>Gandalin</hi>) that our men are determined ſhortly to give them battel, they pray you to come unto them. Truly (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian) Gandalin</hi> my friend, you have wrought the matter well, and I thank you for the pains that you have taken. My Lord (ſaid the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>) are you not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that we go unto them? For my part, I had rather loſe one of mine arms, then fail thereof. Brother (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) to morrow if it pleaſeth God, the great ſerpent ſhall bring us thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: before that time it had always uſed to ſail of it ſelf, but
<pb facs="tcp:57308:125"/>
as then it failed. For when they were entered into it, it ſtirred not, whereat <hi>Gandalin</hi> much abaſhed, could not refrain to ſay: By god, this veſſel is like to the horſe with the white leg, that failed us when we have moſt néed. Friend (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) I am ſurely perſwaded that this procéedeth by reaſon of <hi>Urgandas</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, who at this time is in <hi>Melies</hi> power, and ſo well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted, that her art profiteth her as little as this veſſel doth us that moved by her inchantments, which at this preſent hath no means to ſtir, as you may well perceive. And <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ſaid true, for at the ſame time the country wherein <hi>Urganda</hi> dwelt, called <hi>the unknown Iſland,</hi> (becauſe it was always inviſible) was as then diſcovered and ſéen of all men. With that <hi>Gandalin</hi> counſelled them to enter into the Pinnace which <hi>Eſplandian</hi> the the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> did, and having a good wind, ſailed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> &amp; on a ſunday in the morning they eſpied the veſſels of king <hi>Childadan</hi> and <hi>Quedragant,</hi> which not long after they boarded, where <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> were received with great joy: after that he went to ſée his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the reſt of the Knights that were on land, and after an infinite number of imbracings and welcomes on all ſides, they determined to viſit their enemies ſomewhat nearer, whereby many brave skirmiſhes were made, where the women of Quéen <hi>Calafre</hi> were continually in arms, and among the reſt, a ſiſter of the Quéens named <hi>Liote,</hi> a hardy and valiant Lady, that took a Frenchman priſoner, which certified the Souldan of <hi>Liquie</hi> that <hi>Amadis de Gaule</hi> King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> and <hi>Eſplandian</hi> his Son were in the army.

               <p>This Letter given to the Gentlewoman that bare the firſt to <hi>Norandel,</hi> ſhe went unto the Chriſtians camp, and being adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed which was <hi>Amadis</hi> tent, entered therein, as he ſat talking with king <hi>Luiſart, Eſplandian,</hi> and other good knights. Where knéeling on the ground, ſhe asked which of them was the knight of the great Serpent and his father. <hi>Amadis</hi> ſpake unto her and ſaid: Gentlewoman, I am the one, and this is my Son. Is it your pleaſure to ſpeak with us? The gentle woman caſting her eye upon <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> marvelling at his great beauty, ſpake &amp; ſaid In good faith king <hi>Amadis,</hi> I verily believe that this is he, for I have heard him in divers places eſteemed for the ſame that now I do behold in him. Gentlewoman (ſaid <hi>Amadis</hi>) if you came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our camp onely to ſée him, you now have your deſire. That hath not bin only the cauſe (ſaid ſhe) but to bring this letter which the Souldan of <hi>Liquie</hi> and quéen <hi>Calafre</hi> ſend unto you both: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having read it, I pray you return an anſwer. With that (<hi>Amadis</hi> having taken it in his hand) the Gentlewoman depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the rent attending their reſolution. King <hi>Amadis</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving read it, ſhewed it to King <hi>Luiſart</hi> and the reſt that were in preſence, wherewith there a roſe great controverſie among them concerning the refuſal or acceptation of the combate, for that the moſt part of them were of adviſe it ſhould not be accepted, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divers great and evident reaſons to confirm the ſame, as the greater number of enemies they had before them ready to give
<pb facs="tcp:57308:126"/>
them battel, and if it happen (ſaid they) that fortune ſhould be contrary to King <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Eſplandian</hi> (in whom partly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth our hope) ſuch hard chance would bréed great fear in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers men that are now very willing and ready to do the beſt they can. Others held the contrary, ſaying that it would be ſhame unto them all, for that refuſal onely would much incourage the enemy: but they were of this opinion, that it might well be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that the number of the combatants might be greater. In good truth (ſaid <hi>Amadis</hi>) be it of two againſt two, twenty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt twenty, or of greater number, the victory is in the hands of God. Wherefore in refuſing thereof, I ſhould do my ſelf wrong, and cauſe a great blemiſh to all Chriſtendom, that would not be defaced in long time after. Beſides I have great hope of Gods help herein, for whoſe faith and honor I have undertaken this voyage. When <hi>Eſplandian</hi> heard his fathers mind, he ſpake boldier and ſaid: That he would take that combate upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone, not onely againſt the Souldan and the Quéen, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt two others more with them, rather then it ſo ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed: whereupon it was concluded, that <hi>Amadis</hi> and he would fight, and ſending for the meſſenger into the tent, <hi>Amadis</hi> ſaid unto her: Gentlewoman, you ſhall tell the Souldan and the Quéen that I and my ſon are content to do as they require, wherefore ſet them chuſe what arms they will, and for the place it ſhall be betwéen their camp and ours: aſſuring them on the faith of a King, that not one of our ſoldiers ſhall once remove how ſoever we ſpéed, which we deſire likewiſe at their hands: and if it be their deſire to have the combate fought this day, we are content to do it. With that the Gentlewoman returned, and coming to the Souldans tent, ſhe declared her meſſage unto them, being ſuch as you have heard: whereof the Souldan was glad, but eſpecially the Quéen, for the great deſire ſhe had to ſée <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> whereof ſhe asked the Gentlewomen what ſhe thought of him. Madam (ſaid ſhe) I have in my life time ſeen many men and women that nature had indued with great beauty but by the gods I confeſs it is all but painting in regard of that I have found in him: for he is ſo fair and beautiful, that the more I think thereon, ſo much the more it maketh me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb facs="tcp:57308:126"/>
ſuch beauty to be rather divine them humane. That is much (ſaid the Queen.) I know not (ſaid the Gentlewoman) what you mean by that word Much, but I am well aſſured, if you had ſeen him as I did, that you would ſay as much as I do, and it may be more. Truly (ſaid the Queen) before I enter in combate with him, I will firſt ſee him unarmed, and ſpeak with him, not as an enemy to an enemy, but as friends commonly do one unto the other. Madam (ſaid the Souldan) ſeeing it is your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, it were good our Gentlewoman went again unto them, to deſire them to give you leave to come and viſit them in their camp, not to procure them any cauſe of envy but to do them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor: and for that cauſe to deſire their ſafe conduct. This coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel ſeemed good unto the Queen, and without longer ſtaying ſhe ſent the Gentlewoman back again unto <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Eſplandian</hi> whom ſhe found yet in the Tent whereas ſhe left them. With that ſhe told them what her meſſage was, and the great deſire the Queen had to ſee them before they entred into combate. King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> could not refrain laughing to hear the Gentlewoman ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the affection her miſtreſs had, asking king <hi>Luiſart</hi> what he thought therein. Son (ſaid he) deny not her requeſt, for I aſſure you (ſince our coming hither) I have heard the Queen to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed a wiſe and beautiful Princeſs. You hear our anſwer (ſaid <hi>Amadis</hi> to the Gentlewoman) let the Queen come hither when ſhe thinketh good, for ſhe ſhall be heartily welcome. With that the Gentlewoman returned to the Queen, who being greatly pleaſed with that anſwer, determined the next day to go unto them. But ſhe knew not well what manner of apparrel ſhe were beſt to wear: ſometimes ſhe thought it fit to go as ſhe uſed when ſhe went to battel, and then preſently changed opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, thinking a womans apparrel would be more ſeemly and convenient, ſeeing ſhe went not to try their forces, but onely to win the love and favor of <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> if ſhe might procure the ſame. And thinking on it all night long, in the morning when ſhe meant to apparrel her ſelf, ſhe was reſolved to dreſs her as women uſe to do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thinking ſhe had means enough afterward to ſhew her ſelf in habit of a Knight, whereby ſhe might be ſeen both in the one and the other ſort. Whereupon ſhe cauſed her
<pb facs="tcp:57308:127"/>
moſt precious Robes to be brought unto her, and apparrelling her ſelf, forgot not any thing that might once beautifie or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn her perſon, or that in her opinion would deck her well, the better to be liked. And to bear her company ſhe took twelve of her own gentlewomen, ſo well furniſhed and ſet forth with Stones and Pearls, that the like was never ſéen. That done, ſhe ſent unto her ſhips for a moſt ſtrange and monſtrous beaſt: whereupon ſometimes ſhe uſed to ride in great pomp. It was as big as a great Dromadary, the hair long and ſomewhat yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, black ſpots, his two ears hanging down unto his knées, having but one eye, ſhining brighter then a burning glaſs, and ſtood right in the midſt of his forehead: out of his mouth there iſſued two great teeth like horns, and although his feet were cloven like an ox, yet was there no Hart in all the world that could outrun him, were it in plain way, or over rocks. In that manner ſhe entered into the Chriſtans camp, of whom ſhe was not a little wondred at before ſhe came to King <hi>Luiſarts</hi> tent, where <hi>Amadis,</hi> and in a manner all the principal captains of the army ſtayed for her, praying <hi>Quedragant</hi> to go out to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come her, which he did with great courteſie: for he had no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er eſpied her, but he ſtepped forward, and doing her great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, holp her to deſcend, and taking her by the arm, led her, into the tent, where the Lords were all aſſembled, of whom ſhe was moſt honorably received. But when ſhe beheld <hi>Eſplandians</hi> beauty, ſhe was ſo much ſurpriſed with the love of him, that ſhe repented her coming thither, not ſo much for the ſmall hope ſhe had to win him, (being divers in religion) but doubting that the fantaſie newly entred into her mind would ſo much eſtrange her force (by overmuch thinking upon him) when ſhe went to fight, that thereby ſhe ſhould be in danger to loſe the honor and reputation ſhe had gotten in arms among the beſt Knights in all the world: which to prevent, ſhe determined to ſtay the leſs time there, knowing the nature of love to be ſuch, that it can ſteal the hearts of all perſons, and commonly maketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf poſſeſſor of it, before he that hath it in poſſeſſion, can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. And as the Princes entertained her with divers ſwéet and pleaſant ſpeeches, ſhe returned to <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and ſaid: Sir
<pb facs="tcp:57308:127"/>
Knight, for two moſt excellent graces that are in you, I have taken the pains to come and viſit you: The firſt is the gift of beauty, which is ſuch in you, as I could never have imagined the ſame: The other is the force of your body and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of your courage, whereby you are accounted altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible. The one I have ſéen wich mine eyes to be ſo perfect, that I never hope to ſee the like again, although I lived a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years and more: the other, the combate you ſhall have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the moſt puiſſant Souldan of <hi>Liquie</hi> will be a witneſs unto us: and had it not bin that he requeſted me to fight againſt King <hi>Amadis</hi> (becauſe his onely deſire is to prove his body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt yours) I would have tryed it my ſelf. Of one thing can I well aſſure you, that if the honor remain to us and life to you, I will afterward tell you a thing that much importeth me, and which I greatly deſire to let you know before I ſail into my country. Now for this time I have ſatisfied my deſire: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Lords (ſaid ſhe unto all the Princes) I beſeech you par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me in not uſing longer ſpeeches, for I know full well that my long ſtaying with you, (thinking to finde that I hoped for) might poſsibly cauſe me to loſe my ſelf, wherewith I ſhould be overmuch diſpleaſed, for that before ſunſetting I hope to be in place where I will ſhew ſuch valour in arms, that he which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could be vanquiſhed by man (as it is reported) ſhall now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an overthrow at a ſimple womans hand. Madam (ſaid King <hi>Perion</hi>) fortune can do much when it pleaſeth her, if you do as you ſay, truly you ſhall do more then we can well believe, but commonly the workman is known by his work, and becauſe the iſſue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> combate is the glory of him or you, til then we wil defer our judgements. And although <hi>Amadis</hi> perceived himſelf much outraged by the queen, yet he made no ſign thereof, but taking her by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> arm, led her where her company ſtayed, and as ſhe mounted to return, with a ſmiling countenance he ſpake unto her and ſaid, Madam, when we come to dealing of blows, I beſeech you ſhew me not the greateſt extremity you can, becauſe I was always a friend to women, and ever will be during my life: whereunto the queen anſwered not a word, but rode unto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pagans camp to arm her ſelf. Mean time <hi>Brian de Moniaſte</hi> arrived in the Chriſtians camp, who having bin ſent by the King of <hi>Spain</hi> his father with

a great power of men into <hi>Africa,</hi> to beſiege the town of <hi>Ceſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> after called <hi>Centie,</hi> was advertiſed by a pirate, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chriſtians enterpriſe, and how their army &amp; great fléet had paſſed the cape of <hi>Finis terre,</hi> preſently ſent unto his father to deſire him to give him leave to go that voyage: whereunto by much importunity he granted. For which cauſe <hi>Brian</hi> brake up his ſiege of <hi>Cenite,</hi> and entring again into his ſhips ſailed to <hi>Cicile,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Galipoli,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he joyned with the Chriſtian princes that received him moſt gladly.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>QVéen <hi>Calafre</hi> returned to the Pagans camp as you heard before, preſently armed her ſelf, and the Souldan likewiſe, and ſtayed not long before they came unto the place where the combate was aſſigned, where not long after they found <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Eſplandian:</hi> and becauſe the camps were not well aſſured of each other (notwithſtanding the oaths and promiſes on both ſides made) they ſet themſelves in order of battel, not ſtirring one foot: King <hi>Perion</hi> ſending word to <hi>Quedragant</hi> and King <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dadan,</hi> that as they had intelligence from the enemy, they ſhould ſet upon their Army by Sea: the like word was ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that he might like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be prepared: and as the four Combatants were ready to ſtrike each other, the Souldan called <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> asking them if they would not ſwear and kéep promiſe (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the agréement ſent unto them by his gentlewoman) that the vanquiſhers without impeachment ſhould lead away the vanquiſhed. I truly, ſaid they, therefore beware of us. With that <hi>Amadis</hi> made towards the Quéen, and the Souldan againſt <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandian,</hi> to whom he gave ſo great a blow with his launce into the ſhield, that he pierced it through: whereby divers thought aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly he had béen wounded to death, but it was not ſo, for the launce paſſed under his ſaddle without any further hurt: but <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandian</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:57308:128"/>
gave him his exchange, ſtriking him ſo fiercely, that he made him looſe both ſtirrop and ſaddle and fall upon the ground, with ſo great might, that he rolled twice or thrice before he ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in ſuch manner, that the helmet flew off his head. Quéen <hi>Calafre</hi> ran againſt King <hi>Amadis,</hi> and he againſt her: and as they were in the middle of their courſe, <hi>Amadis</hi> turned the butt end of his launce againſt her, &amp; paſſing forward would not ſtrike her: yet ſhe held her launce down and ſtrake his horſe in the ſtéel of his forehead, and withal they met ſo ſtrongly body to body, that therewith the Quéen fell down, and <hi>Amadis</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to light, his horſe was ſo aſtoniſhed with the truncheon of the launce that ſtuck within his forehead. But the Quéen roſe preſently, and with her ſword in hand went towards <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> the like did the Souldan to <hi>Eſplandian</hi> that had ſuffered him to take breath and lace his helmet, not for any good he wiſhed him, but that at the end of his career he eſpied the princeſs <hi>Leonorine</hi> ſtanding on the walls of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whereat he was ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed, that every man ſaid, the Souldan had hurt him in the body. Nevertheleſs within ſhort ſpace after they knew the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: for he lighted on foot, where between them two was fought the moſt perillous combat that ever was ſéen, for <hi>Rodri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue</hi> was as valiant a Knight in arms as any in his time: but <hi>Eſplandian</hi> handled him in ſuch maner, that oftentimes he made him clean forget the ſubtilties that commonly he uſed in ſuch affairs, and in the end uſed him ſo hardly, that it might evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſéen the victory would be his. Mean time the Quéen uſed all her force to overcome King <hi>Amadis,</hi> whom holding in his hand a great truncheon of a launce in ſtead of a ſword, gave her ſuch a blow on the creſt of her helmet, that he made her eyes ſtart within her head. Wherewith ſhe being much offended, ſpake unto him, and ſaid: What ſir Knight? Do you think me either to be a dog or elſe a country clown, that you ſéem to beat me with a ſtaff? By my head before you eſcape out of my hands, there is no armor you have but will be needful for you to the ſafegard of your life. <hi>Calafre</hi> (ſaid <hi>Amadis</hi>) all my life time I have been a ſervant unto Ladies, and if at this time I ſhould begin with you to ſhew them ill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You account me then (ſaid the Queen) one of that number: but you ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently feel that I am ſomething more: with that ſhe took her ſword in both hands, and in great choller gave him ſuch a blow, that ſhe clave his ſhield in two, and thinking to double her ſtroke, <hi>Amadis</hi> ſtepped unto her and plucked hers from off her neck, with ſuch force, that ſhe was conſtrained to kneel upon the ground. Nevertheleſs ſhe roſe preſently again, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to be revenged, uſed all her force to charge <hi>Amadis,</hi> who turning aſide gave her ſuch a blow with his truncheon hard by the ear, and therewith made her ſo aſtoniſhed, that her ſword fell out of her hand: wherewith he ſtepped forward, and taking her by the helmet, ſaid unto her: Now you ſhall be my priſoner whether you will or not, as well as the Souldan is priſoner to my ſon. With that the Queen looked aſide and perceived that <hi>Amadis</hi> ſaid true: wherefore ſhe ſaid: Truly I am your priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſeeing fortune will have it ſo: and therewith <hi>Rodrigue</hi> and <hi>Eſplandian</hi> came unto them, and they four going out of the liſts, went unto the Chriſtians camp: the Pagans that ſaw them led away in whom in a manner conſiſted moſt of their hope, when the camps ſhould joyn in battel, made countenance to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue them: which cauſed the Chriſtians to ſtand all day in order of battel: mean time they agreed among themſelves to ſend the Souldan and the Queen unto <hi>Conſtantinople, Gandalin</hi> having charge to bring them thither, and preſent them to the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine,</hi> from <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> who thanked them moſt heartily.

There were in the City forty thouſand men, whereof he appointed thirty thouſand to iſſue forth upon the enemies rereward, as ſoon as they perceived the battel once begun, and gave likewiſe intelligence to King <hi>Childadan</hi> and <hi>Quedragant,</hi> that his ſpies had brought him
<pb facs="tcp:57308:129"/>
news that <hi>Alphorax</hi> had unfurniſhed his ſhips of men to ſtrengthen their army on land, truſting to the ſtraights which they mean to kéep, hoping thereby to ſail into the <hi>Majorque</hi> ſeas, if fortune favor not their enterpriſe: and there it would be good (with the other Chriſtian princes adviſe) that they ſhould ſet upon him, and that <hi>Frandalo</hi> with his Fléet ſhould ſecond them.

But to return to King <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mato</hi> and his forces: About an hour before day, according to their former determinations, they began to march againſt the Chriſtians, thinking to finde them ſléeping, and thereby to ſtay their watch before they ſhould have means to ſet themſelves in order of battel.

               <p>THe Obſequies and Funerals of the Kings, Princes, Lords and others, that died in the battel, being finiſhed, the wounded cured, and all things ſet at reſt: the Emperor of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> knowing that <hi>Amadis</hi> and thoſe that were come with him from the Weſtern parts, would return again into their countries, deſired them to aſſemble, ſhewing them that his meaning was to let them know what he determined to do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they went from thence? The next day in the morning they all met in the Emperors great hall, and he ſtanding in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, ſpake unto them and ſaid: My brethren, Lords, and good friends, the bond wherein I ſtand bounden unto you is ſo great,
<pb facs="tcp:57308:132"/>
that although it hath pleaſed God to make me Emperor of all <hi>Grecia,</hi> yet I am well aſſured, it is far beyond my poor ability to ſatisfie you for the ſame, eſtéeming the honor and riches that I now have (next under God) be it little or much, to procéed from you: I am now thréeſcore years of age, wholly aged and decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, by reaſon of the pains that in my youthful years I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually taken in following arms: ſo it is I have but one child, which is a Daughter, the onely ſtaff and hope of my old years, whom I have determined (if you think good) to give in marriage unto the valiant Knight <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> and with her likewiſe to inveſt him with the Empire and Government of all my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys. And the better to live ſolitarily, and to ſeparate my ſelf from worldly company, I have determined to go (with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſs my Wife) into the Monaſtery that I cauſed to be made, there to live religiouſly, calling upon God, and doing pennance for the evils I have committed heretofore. Wherefore my good Lord and friends I pray you, if this my determination like you well, let every man give conſent, and you firſt (ſaid he unto king <hi>Amadis</hi>) to whom the matter toucheth nearer than to any of the reſt, as being father and ſon. My Lord (ſaid he) my ſon ſhall do as you command him. I will tell you (ſaid the Emperor) I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that among other Prophecies which ought to happen in this our time, there is one that maketh me (as I think) agrée with you in one conſent. <hi>Eſplandian</hi> hath on his body (as I have underſtood) certain characters, which ſhew his name and others that in no wiſe can be read, but only by the woman that is ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be his wife, let us now ſée if it be my daughter or not: with that he ſent for the Princeſs <hi>Leonorine,</hi> who being brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Empereſs and divers other Ladies, the Emperor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> to open his doublet and ſhew them the letters he had born upon his body from his mothers womb, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed not, but before them all ſhewed them openly, where every man might eaſily perceive the white characters, containing this word <hi>Eſplandian</hi> but they could not know the red: wherefore the Emperor cauſed his Daughter to come néer, asking her what ſhe could do therein? My Lord (ſaid ſhe) not long before <hi>Melie</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed <hi>Urganda,</hi> ſhe and I being alone in my chamber, ſhe ſent to

fetch one of the books that had bin taken from her, covered with gold, whereon the Enchantreſs was engraven, and I remember that I ſaw therein the like characters that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> beareth on his body, and over them their ſignification, which is nothing elſe but his name and mine. Daughter (ſaid the Emperor) if you have the book ſtill, cauſe it to be brought hither: whereunto ſhe obeyed. The book being brought, ſhe ſhewed him the place that <hi>Melie</hi> had read unto her, containing that which followeth:</p>
